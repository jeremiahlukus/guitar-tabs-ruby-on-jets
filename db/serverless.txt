D[G]ear Savior, Thou art[G7] mine,
How sw[C]eet the thought to[G] me;
Let me[D] repeat Thy[Em] name,
And l[A7]ift my heart to [D]Thee.

Th[G]ou art the sinner’s f[G7]riend,
So I Th[C]y friendship claim,[G]
A sinne[D]r saved by g[Em]race,
When [A7]Thy sweet messa[D]ge came.

Thy par[C]d’ning voice I hear[G]d;
And joy[D] and peace ca[Em]me in
While[A7] list’ning to Th[D]y word.

So let [C]me call Thee mine.[G]
I cannot doubt Thy word,

Hymns #319

Co[D]me, Thou Fount of every b[A]lessing,
Tune my hea[G]rt[D] to sing[A] Thy gra[D]ce;
Streams of mercy, nev[A]er ceasing,
Call for [G]songs of[A] loudest [D]praise.
Jesus sought me[G] when a strange[D]r,
Wand’ring from the [G]face [D]of God;
He, to save my soul f[A]rom danger,
Inter[G]posed Hi[A]s preciou[D]s blood.

O [D]to grace how great a debto[A]r
Daily I’m c[G]on[D]straine[A]d to be!   [D]
Let that grace, Lord,[A] like a fetter,
Bind my [G]wand’ring[A] heart to [D]Thee.
Teach me, Lord, [G]some rapturous [D]measure,
Meet for me Thy gr[G]ace to p[D]rove,
While I sing the coun[A]tless treasure
Of my[G] God’s unc[A]hanging l[D]ove.

P[D]rone to wander, Lord, I f[A]eel it;
Prone to l[G]ea[D]ve the Go[A]d I lov[D]e:
Take my heart, oh, ta[A]ke and seal it
With Th[G]y Spirit f[A]rom abov[D]e.
Rescued thus fro[G]m sin and dan[D]ger,
Purchased by the Sa[G]vior’[D]s blood,
May I walk on earth a stranger,
As a son and heir of God.

W[C]hile the endless ages r[G]oll;      [Em]
To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,
There to bathe my weary soul.

And in that Light of life I'll walk
Till trav'lling days are done.

 I’v[D]e turned my back u[A]pon the w[G]orld     [D]
 With al[G]l its idl[A]e pleas[D]ures,
 And set my heart on better t[A]hings,
 On hi[E7]gher, holier treasur[A]es;
 No mo[D]re it’s glitt[A]er and it[G]s glare,  [D]
 And van[A7]ity shall blind me[D];
 I’ve crossed the sepa[D7]rating li[G]ne,    [Gm]
 And lef[D]t the world behind me.[A7]       [D]

   Far, far behind[A7] me! Far, far behind m[D]e!
   I’ve crossed the sepa[D7]rating l[G]ine,   [Gm]

I’[D]ve left the old s[A]ad life of[G] sin,     [D]
Its folli[G]es all f[A]orsake[D]n;
My standing place is now in C[A]hrist,
His ho[E7]ly vows I’ve taken;[A]
Benea[D]th the standar[A]d of the [G]cross   [D]
The world[A7] henceforth shal[D]l find me;
I’ve passed in Christ[D7] from deat[G]h to [Gm]life,
And left [D]the world behind me.  [A7]    [D]

   Far, far behind [A7]me! Far, far behind me![D]
   I’ve passed in Christ [D7]from dea[G]th to l[Gm]ife,
   And left[D] the world behind me.[A7]        [D]
My [D]soul shall ne’er [A]return agai[G]n        [D]
Back to[G] its fo[A]rmer sta[D]tion,
For here alone is perfect pe[A]ace,
And re[E7]st from condemnati[A]on;
I’ve [D]made exchang[A]e of master[G]s now,    [D]
The vow[A7]s of glory bind m[D]e,
And once for all I’[D7]ve left the[G] world, [Gm]
Yes, le[D]ft the world behind me[A7].      [D]

  Far, far behind [A7]me! Far, far behind m[D]e!
 And once for all I’ve [D7]left the[G] world,[Gm]
 Yes, lef[D]t the world behind me.[A7]        [D]

My [D]choice is made f[A]orevermor[G]e,       [D]
I want [G]no othe[A]r Savio[D]r;
I ask no purer happiness [A]
Than [E7]His sweet love and[A] favor;
My he[D]art is fixe[A]d on Jesu[G]s Christ, [D]
No more[A7] the world shall[D] blind me;
I’ve crossed the R[D7]ed Sea of[G] His dea[Gm]th,
And lef[D]t the world behind [A7]me.     [D]

 Far, far behind [A7]me! Far, far behind me[D]!
 I’ve crossed the Red [D7]Sea of H[G]is deat[Gm]h,
 And left[D] the world behind me.[A7]       [D]

The na[D]me of Jesus is our sta[A7]nd,   [D]

Not on ourselves do we rely[A7-D],
  But mighty [A]Lord, on[E] Thee.    [A]
O[A7]ur weapo[D]ns are not arms of flesh,
  But ours the Spirit’s sword,  [A]
And God[D]’s whole armor putting[D7] on,   [G]

Behold[D], the foe doth meet and[A7] plot,[D]
   Stand[A] firm in one acc[D]ord!
Though war be fierce and dar[A7-D]kness thick,
   Resist him[A] in the [E]Lord!      [A]
If [A7]one thr[D]u fear should backward turn,
   He undermines the rest.       [A]
Oh, do [D]not let your brothers d[D7]own,     [G]
   Nor by y[D]ou be [G]di[D]st[A]ressed. [D]
The de[D]vil knows his time is [A7]short, [D]
 He is [A]the more enraged[D],
And by his wiles would weake[A7-D]n us
 Before the b[A]attle’s [E]waged.     [A]
T[A7]he trial[D]s now more numerous are,
 The suff’ring e’en more sore,   [A]
The for[D]ce of hell opposing us [D7]       [G]
 More drea[D]dful [G]th[D]an[A] before.  [D]

What sh[D]ould our posture be toda[A7]y      [D]
   In su[A]ch a desperate ho[D]ur?
Should we our ease and pleasure[A7-D] seek
   And let th[A]e foe devo[E]ur?         [A]
Or[A7] with in[D]creasing conflict strong,
   Courageous to endure?            [A]
’Tis he[D]re that life or death is w[D7]on!    [G]
   Who will[D] God’s [G]pr[D]ai[A]se secure?[D]

For C[D]hrist the Lord we then [A7]would s[D]tand,
  He is[A] the Conqueror!    [D]
For Him we would endure the [A7-D]pain
  Until the f[A]ight is o’[E]er.     [A]
The[A7] hour[D] of triumph soon we’ll see—
   The Lord will come again;      [A]

T[A]here is a fount[D]ain filled [A]with blood
Drawn from Immanuel’s[E] veins;
And [A]sinners, plunged be[D]neath th[A]at flood,
Lose all the[E]ir guilty[A] stains:
Lose all the[A7]ir [D]guilty stains,
Lose [A]all their gui[E]lty stains;
And s[A]inners, plunged ben[D]eath t[A]hat flood,
Lose all the[E]ir guilty[A] stains.

T[A]he dying thief r[D]ejoiced t[A]o see
That fountain in his [E]day;
And t[A]here may I, thoug[D]h vile a[A]s he,
Wash all my[E] sins aw[A]ay:
Wash all my[A7] si[D]ns away,
Wash a[A]ll my sins [E]away;
And th[A]ere may I, thoug[D]h vile a[A]s he,
Wash all my[E] sins aw[A]ay.

De[A]ar dying Lamb, T[D]hy prec[A]ious blood
Shall never lose its p[E]ower,
Till al[A]l the ransomed o[D]nes of [A]God
Be saved, to s[E]in no [A]more:
Be saved, to s[A7]in [D]no more,
Be saved[A], to sin n[E]o more;
Till all[A] the ransomed o[D]nes of [A]God,
Be saved to si[E]n no m[A]ore.

E’[A]er since by fait[D]h I saw t[A]he stream
Thy flowing wounds supp[E]ly,
Redee[A]ming love has been m[D]y them[A]e,
And shall be[E] till I d[A]ie:
And shall be[A7] ti[D]ll I die,
And sh[A]all be till I[E] die;
Redeem[A]ing love has been m[D]y them[A]e,
And shall be[E] till I d[A]ie.

When[A] this poor lis[D]ping, st[A]ammering tongue
Lies silent in the grav[E]e,
Then in [A]a nobler, sweete[D]r son[A]g,
I’ll sing Thy[E] power t[A]o save:
I’ll sing Thy[A7] po[D]wer to save,
I’ll sin[A]g Thy power[E] to save;
Then in [A]a nobler, sweete[D]r son[A]g,

  [G]The half cannot be [C]fancied of [A]su[A7]ch a treasure-[D]st[D7]ore,
  And [G]every day He’s d[C]earer than He ev[G]er was[D7] be[G]fo[C]re[G]!

[G]We have found the Ch[G7]rist who’s [C]all in [G]all;
He is everything to[D7] us;
O how b[G]lest up[G7]on His na[C]me to [G]call,
How div[A7]ine, how glori[D]ou[D7]s!

  It is[G] joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  [D7]Full of glory, [G]full of glory;

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the hal[C]f has n[D7]ever yet been to[G]ld!

[G]We have found that [G7]Christ the Sp[C]irit is[G]
Who within our spirit d[D7]wells;
How ava[G]ilable[G7], how near[C] He is,[G]
And His[A7] sweetness all [D]ex[D7]cels.

  It is[G] joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  [D7]Full of glory, [G]full of glory;

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the hal[C]f has n[D7]ever yet been to[G]ld!

[G]We have found the [G7]way to live b[C]y Chri[G]st –
Pray His Word and call His [D7]name!
This – [G]the e[G7]ating, dr[C]inking [G]– has sufficed
And its [A7]worth we now p[D]ro[D7]claim.

  It is[G] joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  [D7]Full of glory, [G]full of glory;

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the hal[C]f has n[D7]ever yet been to[G]ld!

[G]We have found the loc[G7]al church, [C]our h[G]ome;
We are home and home indee[D7]d!
Nevermor[G]e in B[G7]abylon we [C]roam; [G]
In the c[A7]hurch is all w[D]e [D7]need.

  It is[G] joy unspeakable and full of glory
  [D7]Full of glory, [G]full of glory;

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the hal[C]f has n[D7]ever yet been to[G]ld!

[G]We have found that mee[G7]ting with the s[C]ai[G]nts
Is the greatest joy on ea[D7]rth;
’Tis by t[G]his ou[G7]r spirit n[C]ever fa[G]ints
And our l[A7]ives are filled[D] w[D7]ith worth.

  It is[G] joy unspeakable and full of glory,

 [D]Jesus Lord, I’m captured by Thy bea[Em]uty,  [E7]
 All my h[A7]eart to Thee I open w[D]ide;
 Now set free from all religious [Em]dut[E7]y,
 Only l[A7]et me in Thyself a[D]bide.
 As I’m gazing here upon Thy glo[G]ry[Em],
 Fill my [A7]heart with radiancy d[D]ivine;

 Mingle n[A7]ow Thy Spirit, Lord, with mi[D]ne.

[D]Shining One – how clear the sky above m[Em]e!     [E7]
Son of M[A7]an, I see Thee on the thr[D]one!
Holy One, the flames of God consume me,[Em]      [E7]
Till m[A7]y being glows with [D]Thee alone.
Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy s[G]plendor,[Em]
All self-[A7]love and glory sank [D]in shame;
Now my[D] heart its love and prai[Em]ses rend[E7]er,
Tasting a[A7]ll the sweetness of Thy na[D]me.

[D]Precious Lord, my flask of ala[Em]baster  [E7]
Gladly [A7]now I break in love for T[D]hee;

Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon The[G]e;[Em]
Loving T[A7]hee, I’m deeply satis[D]fied.
Love [D]outpoured from hidden dep[Em]ths withi[E7]n me,

Gladly [Am]wil[A7]l I hear Thy c[D]all;

J[G]esus, the al[C]l-inc[G]lu[D7]siv[G]e land,
Is everyt[D]hing to [G]me:
A C[D]hrist of brooks, of d[G]epths and [Em]streams,
And f[D]ountains bu[A7]bbling fr[D]ee[D7].
[G]Springing from va[Am]lleys an[G]d [C]fr[G]om hills,
Flowing till [Am]eve[G]ry[C] p[G]art He fills,
[G]He waters us[Em] — [G]how glorious —[D]
[G]By[D] H[GCG]is life!

J[G]esus is now[C] the l[G]an[D7]d o[G]f wheat —
Incarnate[D], crucifi[G]ed.
But[D] resurre[G]ction life i[Em]s He
By ba[D]rley s[A7]ign[D]if[D7]ied.
[G]He is a l[Am]and of [G]fi[C]gs[G] and vines —
Blood of the grape, [Am]the[G] c[C]he[G]ering wine.
[G]With such s[Em]upp[G]lies He satisf[D]ies —
[G]Ch[D]ri[GCG]st our land!
[G]O what a ric[C]h, ab[G]un[D7]dan[G]t Christ:
Our pome[D]granate [G]true,
Th[D]e olive tr[G]ee whose oil is[Em] now
Ano[D]inting [A7]us [D]an[D7]ew.
[G]Rich milk[Am] and honey [G]He[C] d[G]oth bring,

We [D]never lack[G] one thing in[Em] Him,
So r[D]ich, so[A7] fu[D]ll[D7] is He.
[G]He is a la[Am]nd so vast, [G]im[C]me[G]nse;
He is complet[Am]e i[G]n [C]ev[G]ery sense.
[G]How He expa[Em]nds — land[G] of all [D]lands—
[G]In[D] o[GCG]ur heart!

[G]Christ is a l[C]and o[G]f [D7]iro[G]n stones,
Whence co[D]mes auth[G]ority.
We[D] must dig o[G]ut this solid C[Em]hrist

[G]Then we mu[Am]st through t[G]he[C] s[G]ufferings pass
To be refined[Am] as[G] b[C]ur[G]nished brass.

My o[A]ld man has been crucified with Him,
With a[E7]ll its foul corruption deep with[A]in;
And buried too [D]its nature serpentin[A]e,
Completely finis[E]hed – thi[A]s [A7]gre[D]at fact is mine,
I [A]ho[E7]ld [A]it[D] f[A]ast.

But th[A]ere’s a Person in my spirit now,
Born a[E7]s a babe so small, so weak, so lo[A]w;
Who by the W[D]ord’s pure milk will grow to[A] be
The overco[E]ming inne[A]r [A7]man[D] in me
To [A]gain m[E7]y h[A]ea[D]rt[A].

Christ [A]as my Person must possess my heart
And be pre[E7]eminent in every [A]part.
The former o[D]wner died but haunts it [A]still.
O Lord, move [E]in; my m[A]in[A7]d, [D]emotion, will
Now[A] welcom[E7]e T[A]he[D]e.[A]

In spi[A]rit mingled, we are one, O Lord,
The human and[E7] divine in one acco[A]rd;
Yet Thou must[D] have a proper facu[A]lty
That all Th[E]y gloriou[A]s [A7]per[D]sonality
May [A]be expr[E7]ess[A]ed[D]. [A]

So, Lo[A]rd, I give my heart to Thee today,
That it may be T[E7]hy home in every wa[A]y,
A place for T[D]hee to come and settle d[A]own,
And all T[E]hy grand r[A]ec[A7]ove[D]ry work to crown
In [A]one new[E7] ma[A]n.[D]  [A]

 [A]From my spirit with[A7]in flows a fo[D]untain of life —
 [B7]The[E] Triune God fl[E7]owing in me; [A]
 God the Father’s the s[A7]ource,
 Christ the [D]Son is the course,
 [B7]And the S[E]pirit im[E7]parts life to m[A]e.

   Lord, I [E]treasure the sweet flow of [A]life,
   And my sou[D]l-life at last I lay [A]do[E]wn;
   O Lord, de[A]epen the pur[A7]e flow of li[D]fe;
   At Your co[A]ming may lif[E]e be my cro[A]wn.

[A]In the fresh, tender [A7]grass Jesu[D]s makes me lie down;
[B7]He [E]leads me by water[E7]s of rest[A];
No more struggle and stra[A7]in;
All self-effo[D]rt is vain;
[B7]In the flo[E]w I am per[E7]fectly bles[A]sed.
   Lord, I tr[E]easure the sweet flow of l[A]ife,
   And my soul-[D]life at last I lay [A]down; [E]
   O Lord, de[A]epen the pur[A7]e flow of li[D]fe;
   At Your comi[A]ng may lif[E]e be my crow[A]n.

[A]Jesus called me one[A7] day to the[D] Holiest Place,
[B7]To [E]live in His pre[E7]sence divi[A]ne;
Hallelujah, I’ve h[A7]eard
An encouragi[D]ng word:
[B7]"Abide — [E]you’re a [E7]branch in th[A]e vine."

   Lord, I tr[E]easure the sweet flow of l[A]ife,
   And my soul-[D]life at last I lay [A]down; [E]
   O Lord, de[A]epen the pur[A7]e flow of li[D]fe;
   At Your comi[A]ng may lif[E]e be my crow[A]n.

[D]Lord, we would our [A7]every thought b[D]e [D7]captured
[G]By the rich enjoyment in Y[D]our Word.
[A]In it we’re supplied[Bm], our mind there w[D]ill abide,
[G]Till our thoughts[A7] are wholly sanc[D]tified.

[D]Let’s keep pract[A7]icing the appli[D]ca[D7]tion

[G]We have an inner life; tha[C]t’s for our daily life;

[G]He will become in us our inne[D]r [G]life.

[G]Out from our inner life wi[C]ll come our daily life,
[G]And all our living be filled up with[D] Christ.
[G]Then as we live by Him, H[C]e lives His life in us,
[G]And He becomes to us our dail[D]y [G]life.
[G]The real experience of Chr[C]ist in daily life,
[G]Will fill the meeting life with Chris[D]t Himself.
[G]Not empty forms and such, [C]but Christ will be so much;
[G]And we will see Him here as th[D]e [G]meeting life.

  Satan tre[D7]mbles at the Body!

  Halle[G]lujah, we are [D7]in the Body[GCG] now!

[G]There are seven golden lampstands
In th[C]e nature all divi[G]ne —

When we’re[G] one and share God’s nature,
How t[C]he lampstand th[G]en does shine —
Hallelujah, [D]it is brightly shin[GCG]ing now!

  Hallelujah for the Body!
  For the l[D7]ampstands of the Body!
  F[C]or the golden, shi[G]ning Body!
  Halle[G]lujah, it is bri[D7]ghtly shinin[GCG]g now!
[G]How may we express such oneness,
Be d[C]ivine and shining[G] too?
Hallelujah, e[A7]ating Jesus is the [D]way!
He’s the tr[G]ee of life, the manna,
And t[C]he feast that’s[G] ever new —
Hallelujah, [D]we may eat Him every[GCG] day!

[G]It is not a school or fact’ry

But a g[D7]arden where our Lord can plant a[GCG]nd sow.

So He’s placed us all here corporately
To be Hi[C]s garden fair,
Where H[D7]e’s free to cultivate and make u[GCG]s grow.

There’s a fr[C]uit-producing tree
Full of[D7] life and so available [GCG]to eat.

So be simple, don’t be hardened,
Drop your [C]concepts — eat that tree!
Take in [D7]Jesus every moment — He’s so swee[GCG]t!

  I’m so [G7]happy i[C]n this lovely place,

  There is no finer pleasure

[G]With the tree there is the water,
Flowing G[C]od in Christ to us,
Quench[D7]ing all our dryness, ending all o[GCG]ur strife.

Hallelujah! In His garden
Jesus [C]flows Himself to us,
As the [D7]full supply for us to gro[GCG]w in life.

  I’m so [G7]happy i[C]n this lovely place,
  [D7]In the garden growing in His [GCG]grace!

  There is no finer pleasure
  Than to e[C]at the living tree
  And to [D7]get the living water i[GCG]nto me.

[G]Aren’t you satisfied and thankful
That our [C]Lord has brought you in
Where Hi[D7]s pleasures and His riches flow so fr[GCG]ee?

So be happy and be joyful,
In the [C]spirit feast on Him,
So God’s ga[D7]rden can bear fruit ab[GCG]undantly.

[G]What a hap[C]py[G] day
When I no more could tu[C]rn away,
When Jesus took my he[G]art from the black of [Em]night
In[Am]to [D]the kingdom of H[GCG]is light.

[G]Now my life[C]’s[G] begun,
The “really life” that’s i[C]n the Son.

No more am I enthrall[G]ed by earth’s empty dre[Em]ams;
D[Am]eep[D] in me flows a living[GCG] stream.

[G]As I turn [C]to[G] Him
He fills me with His life[C] within.
His life beco[G]mes my life in re[Em]ality;
Oh[Am], h[D]allelujah, He’s in[GCG] me!

I [G]just love Y[C]ou[G], Lord,
With other loves, You bre[C]ak the cord.
You’ll be my [G]life for all [Em]eternity;
Y[Am]ou [D]are the only One fo[GCG]r me.

[D]Never did I dream be[F#m]fore,
[G]Such a place could e’er be fo[D]und,
Where the tears of sorrow ce[F#m]ase,
[G]Songs of endless joy a[D]bound.
One who se[G]ldom ever sa[D]ng,
[Em]Now delights his voice to r[A]aise;
Singing[G] hymns with all the s[D]aints,
[Em]Ech[A]oing the ceaseless pr[D]aise.

[D]Day by day the world [F#m]goes on,
[G]Just as it has gone befo[D]re.
Millions grasp and clutc[F#m]h at life,
[G]Wond’ring if there cou[D]ld be more;
Such was [G]I and wou[D]ld be, yet
[Em]Mercy found me out somehow;[A]
With wha[G]t gratefulness I s[D]ay,
[Em]“I’[A]m in God’s own family[D] now.”

[D]How delightful ’tis to [F#m]know;
[G]How subjective, real, and[D] sweet
Is this inward joy of [F#m]grace
[G]We experience when we me[D]et;
Life abund[G]ant Jesus [D]gives
[Em]As my full re[A]ality;
Praise You[G], Lord, it’s reall[D]y true,
[Em]I’m[A] in Your own fami[D]ly.

[D]At the closing of this[F#m] age,
[G]Just before Your kingdom’[D]s dawn,
May You gain a people, Lo[F#m]rd,

[G]For Your dwelling place[D], Your home.
Since fo[G]r me You g[D]ave Your all,
[Em]Everything I[A] lay aside;
For Your [G]church my all I’d [D]give,
[Em]Tha[A]t You would be s[D]atisfied.

Your[Em] heart’s[D] desire[G], is our [D]desire —
We come[G], O Lor[A]d, to bui[D]ld.

 [D]Within those whom Y[F#m]ou’d call
 Put [G]such a restless[A] caring
 For [D]building to g[F#m]ive all —
 These[G] times are for prepa[A]ring;

W[D]hen the Lord turned a[G]gain the cap[D]tivity of[GD] Zion,
We were l[G]ike them that d[D]ream,

We were l[G]ike them that [D]dream.

[D]Then was our mouth filled with [G]laughter,
And our to[D]ngue with [G]si[D]nging:
Then [G]said they among the n[D]ations,
The [G]Lord hath done great t[D]hings,

  The [G]Lo[Em]rd hath done great [D]things for us;
  Where[Em]of [G]we are [A]glad.
  The[G] L[Em]ord hath done great [D]things for us;
  Wher[Em]eof[G] we are [A]gl[A7]ad.

T[D]urn again our captivity[G], O Lord, as [D]the st[GD]reams,
As the str[G]eams in the [D]south,
As the str[G]eams in the [D]south.

Th[D]ey that sow in tear[G]s shall[D] reap [GD]in joy,
They t[G]hat sow in te[D]ars
Shall [G]reap in [D]joy.

H[D]e that goeth[G] forth and [D]we[GD]epeth,
Bearin[G]g precious [D]seed, shall doubtless,
Come aga[G]in with rejoicin[D]g,
Come [G]again with rejoicin[D]g,
Bring[G]ing his sheaves wit[D]h him.

 The [G]Lo[Em]rd hath done great t[D]hings for us;
 Where[Em]of [G]we are g[A]lad.
 The [G]Lo[Em]rd hath done great t[D]hings for us;
 Where[Em]of [G]we are [A]gl[A7]ad.

When the [G]Lord turned[D] again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream,
We were like them that dream.
