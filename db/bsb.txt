1  Jesus loves me, this I know,

   Little ones to Him belong.

2  Jesus, take this heart of mine,
   Make it pure and wholly Thine.
   You have bled and died for me;
   I will henceforth live for Thee.

   Part 1:
             Em      D
1  A certain man was going down
   Em                    D
   From Jerusalem to Jericho,
   Em               D
   Getting farther away from God;
   Em       D                  Em
   To this place of curse he’d go.

2  And as he went among the robbers he fell,
   Who stripped and beat him ‘til he bled,
   And having taken everything that he owned,
   They left him lying there half dead.

3  A certain priest was also going down
   On that same road to Jericho.
   He saw him and passed on the
   opposite side.
   A Levite did the same also.

     Am                        Em
     You know this man who was going down,
     Am                          Em
     This man is me; this man is you,
         Am
     Who living in our fallen life
      Em
     away from God

     Were beaten sore and
     D              Em
     bled from many wounds.

4  We were stripped of all that we should have:
   Our virtue, honour, righteousness.
   We could not stand upright nor hold onto life.
   Toward God: no boldness nor access.

5  Religious ones observing our poor estate,
   Being the same could be no help.
   They passed us by, not daring to
   come close.
   We only heard we’d go to hell.

     Am                    Em
     As sinners under the law condemned,
     Am                           Em
     Which left us beaten and disgraced,
         Am
     We all were robbed and dying from so
     Em
     many hurts,

     From small transgressions
     D              Dsus2
     to our sins so great.

   Interlude: Dsus2 - A - Asus2 - D7

     Part 2:
     G             Dsus4  D    G
     But a certain Good Samaritan,
                            Dsus4
     Despised, of whom they said,
            D       C
     “Don’t give me Jesus!”
     G                D
     Bound up all our wounds,
     Em              C
     Pouring oil and wine upon them,
     G                 D
     Brought us to the inn and said,
           C       G
     “Take care of him.”

   G                D
1  He had to take a journey
      C                 G
   to come down just to reach us.
          Em             C
   Though God, He was so willing
         D
   to become a human babe.
      G                  D
   He came through human living,
     C                  G
   Observed our dire condition,
         Em                 C
   Then, moved with deep compassion,
      G        D        G   D
   He died and rose to save!

2  He came and bound our wounds up;
   He healed these damaged persons.
   He poured in oil and wine—
   His Spirit and His life divine.
   He placed us on His donkey
   to carry us so lowly,
   And brought us to the church life
   With blessing for our care.

3  We love this dear Man-Savior,
   Divine One, fully human,
   Whose tender care, so merciful
   And bountiful to save
   Condemned and dying sinners,
   Reveals the highest standard
   Of His morality seen in
   His precious, saving grace.

(Chorus twice, then last line: )
           C               Am
     “Take care… and whatever you spend
           D
     in addition on him
              D7             G
     When I return, I will repay you.”

   That I from Adam might be free.

1  Drawn to the Cross which Thou hast blest,
         D                G
   With healing gifts for souls distrest,
   A  Bm              G
   To find in Thee my Life, my Rest,

   False pleasures gone, vain hopes denied,
   Deep in Thy wounds my shame to hide,
   Christ crucified, I come.

4  Thou knowest all my griefs and fears,
   Thy grace abused, my misspent years;
   Yet now to Thee, for cleansing tears,
   Christ crucified, I come.

5  I would not, if I could, conceal
   The ills which only Thou canst heal;
   So to the Cross, where sinners kneel,
   Christ crucified, I come.

6  Wash me, and take away each stain,
   Let nothing of my sin remain;
   For cleansing, though it be through pain,
   Christ crucified, I come.

7  To share with Thee Thy life divine,
   Thy very likeness to be mine,
   Since Thou hast made my nature Thine,
   Christ crucified, I come.

8  To be what Thou wouldst have me be,
   Accepted, sanctified in Thee,
   Through what Thy grace shall work in me,
   Christ crucified, I come.

1  Fallen, that’s the way we all begin:
      D       G           A          D
   Imprisoned by the evil fate we’re in.
   D       G                 A         D
   How can we from this hard world of sin
      A   A7
   be saved?

                      G      A      D
     Just by calling Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
     G     A            D
     Every moment, each day!
     G              A        D
     Calling on the name of Jesus—
           Em             A
     We're finding is the way.
           G-D         G-D
     It's Jesus! Lord Jesus!

2  Even though we love the Lord so much,
   Somehow, it seems we get out of touch
   with Jesus, how can we be freed from such
   distress?

3  Sometimes we know we aren’t being real.
   Then times, we just live by how we feel.
   Is there some way we could ever deal
   with self?

4  Christians, scattered throughout all the earth
   are wond’ring— Lord,
   where is Your bride of worth?
   How can all those of the second birth
   be one?

1  In man's labour and his search for meaning
   G                       Em
   Everything is vanity of vanities.

2  God implanted in man's heart eternity,
   A divinely implanted sense of purpose.
   Working through the ages,
   Working through the ages;
   Which nothing under the sun,
   No nothing under the sun,
   But only God can satisfy,
   But only God can satisfy.

3  Song of Songs speaks of the King of Majesty,
   Whose purpose, plan, and goal is that
   He finds a bride,
   Becoming a country man,
   Pursuing a country girl,
   Attracted and charmed by Him,
   Becoming the same as He.
   Now she is fully satisfied,
   And God is fully satisfied.

4  Praise the Triune God who came to be a man.
   Constituting man with His divine life,
   That we may be made God
   In life and in nature
   to express Him corporately,
   Express Him eternally.
   Completely satisfying God,
   Completely satisfying God.

   That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

3  So my brother, if the things that this
   world gives you
   Leave hungers that won't pass away,
   My blessed Lord will come and save you
   If you kneel to Him and humbly pray—

   Once you receive this glorious Christ,
   Never the rest you’ll desire.

3  Though very great is all the world,
   And very small is your heart,
   Yet the great world with all its wealth
   Never can fill your small heart.

4  If you have Christ, you have all joys;
   Without this Christ, only pains;
   Where there is Christ there morning is;
   Where He is not, night remains.

           C                D        C
   For the world is not the place in which
      G
   He dwells.

2  If you wish to find the Lord,
   Do not seek Him in the mind,
   For the mind can only know, it cannot taste.
     It cannot taste, it cannot taste,
     It cannot taste, it cannot taste,
   For the mind can only know, it cannot taste.

3  If you wish to find the Lord,
   You must open up your heart,
   You must open up your heart and let Him in.
     Let Him in, let Him in,
     Let Him in, let Him in,
   You must open up your heart and let Him in.

4  If you wish to let Him in,
   You just call upon His name,
   You just call upon His name and let Him in.
     Call His name, call His name,
     Call His name, call His name,
   You just call upon His name and let Him in.

   Am              G                   F     G
1  If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
   Am                 G            F  G
   Were my life worth living for a day?
   F                 G                   Em  Am
   Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
   Bb                 Am              G
   In the things that soon must pass away?
        Am                             F
   If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
            Am                           F   G
   Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?
   F               G                  Em  Am
   Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
   F            G                    C
   For a moment with a Christ-filled life?

2  Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,
   And a name revered both far and near,
   Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,
   Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;
   If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
   Who endured the cross and died for me,
   Could then all the world afford a refuge,
   Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?

3  O what emptiness!— without the Savior
   'Mid the sins and sorrows here below!
   And eternity, how dark without Him!
   Only night and tears and endless woe!
   What, though I might live without the Savior,
   When I come to die, how would it be?
   O to face the valley's gloom without Him!
   And without Him all eternity!

4  O the joy of having all in Jesus!
   What a balm the broken heart to heal!
   Ne'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,
   Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
   If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
   Nothing else in all the world beside—
   O then everything is mine in Jesus;
   For my needs and more He will provide.

   Dm7      G
1  I just existed empty,
   C                 F
   Not knowing what life was for;
   Dm7           G
   Until one day someone told me
        Am                  A
   That there was something more;
   Dm7        G
   At first I wouldn’t take it—
   C             E
   It seemed too simple to me!

     Am                        Dm7
     Calling His name, “O Lord Jesus!”
     G                       C
     Saying, “Amen,” when He speaks.
     Am                     D
     Filling my spirit with His life,
                G                   F
     Filling my whole life with His life,
                 C               F
     Flooding my living with His life,
                Bb                  A
     Filling my whole life with His life.

2  But then at length I tried it—
   First softly to myself.
   As I called I felt like someone
   Sick brought back to health.
   The flow of life within me,
   I’d never felt before.

3  Then as I called on Jesus,
   I felt that I’d been found!
   I was so full; I was calling
   “Jesus!” right out loud.
   I’d never dreamed that I could
   Know reality by…

4  And now I’m full and happy,
   So satisfied with Him,
   Because He has come and filled me
   Clear up past the brim.
   His life is now my portion—
   I’ll go on all my life, just…

1  I always knew deep down in me
                             Em
   There was a longing to be free,
                           A7
   A kind of hunger deep inside—
              G               D
   To fill it up, I tried and tried.
                                Em  A
   There were a lot of things I had;

   Some things were good,
                     D
   Some things were bad.
                                  Em A7
   But all those things of mine before
               G       D
   Don’t satisfy me anymore.

                               Em
     Now life affords a real reward,

2  Thank You, Lord Jesus, for the wine
   That I enjoy as life divine.
   I thank You, Lord, for mercy all
   That opened me to heed Your call.
   O Lord, now make Your home my heart
   And fully saturate each part.
   O Lord, my words just can’t express
   The way You’ve filled my emptiness!

     O Lord, I know that you will grow
     And from my spirit overflow.
     Lord, saturate me through and through.
     O Lord Jesus, I love You.

3  I always knew deep down in me
   There was a longing to be free,
   A kind of hunger deep inside—
   But now it can be satisfied.
   Christ in my heart— the only way
   To spread within me day by day.
   Lord Jesus! Lord, I have to say
   You’re home in me and home to stay!

   The One reality.
   Love untold— Gospel Thee
   Never getting old— story told eternally.

3  Left the ninety-nine behind—
   You searched until the lost sheep
   You did find;
   Laid me on Your shoulders there,
   You bore me in
   Your tender loving care.
   Rejoicing— You found me,
   Though a small lost sheep—
   You gave all to come find me.

4  Sweeping in my deepest parts,
   You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
   Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
   Exposed me of my sin.
   Repenting— now I see
   Lord, You’re sprinkling me— with the
   blood You shed for me.

5  Eagerly awaiting me
   That I the slightest turn to Thee would make.
   Though my life had been a wreck,
   You ran to me
   And fell upon my neck.
   Kissing me, affectionately,
   Killed the calf for me—
   “Let’s enjoy the jubilee!”

   Out of the depths of ruin untold,
   Into the flock Thy love doth enfold,
   Ever Thy glorious face to behold,

   How could I still remain Your enemy?
   Your love, dear Jesus, disarmed me.

     Christ in us, the hope of glory.

2  Was there e'er story so moving,
   Story of love and pain;
   Was there e'er Bridegroom so loving,
   Seeking our hearts to gain.

3  I am so glad I received Him,
   Jesus my heart's dear King;
   I who so often have grieved Him,
   All to His feet would bring

4  How can I ever be lonely,
   How can I ever fall;
   What can I want, if only
   Christ is my all in all?

5  Now in His bosom confiding,
   This my glad song shall be;
   I am in Christ abiding,
   And Christ abides in me.

   G
1  Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,
   D                        G  G7
   One that never would run dry;
   C                            G        Em
   Unavailing all that earth to me could bring,
   A7                      D  D7
   Nothing seemed to satisfy.

       G
     Drinking at the Fountain that

     never runs dry,
     G               Em          A7      D
     Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;

     In abounding measure,

     I am drinking at the Fountain of life.

2  Through the desert land of sin
   I roam no more,
   For I find a living Spring,
   And my cup of gladness now
   is running o'er,
   Jesus is my Lord and King.

3  Here is sweet contentment as
   the days go by,
   Here is holy peace and rest;
   Here is consolation as the moments fly,
   Here my heart is always blest.

4  Here I find a never ending, sure supply,
   While the endless ages roll;
   To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,
   There to bathe my weary soul.

   It is God in Christ Jesus

   He is flowing within us;
   He is flowing through—
   Hallelujah! He’s moving
   To make everything new.

4  We have this life within us,
   in our spirit today;
   To our spirit we turn, O Lord,

1  Draw me this morning, open my eyes,

   Draw me this morning, 'cause I realise,
             Am
   All this time I've been resting in

   Your sweet embrace.
                Am
   You've been longing to speak to me,
       F      G
   For me to awake.
           Am
   Draw me out of my slumber.
      C           Am
   Supply me with grace.

   'Cause there's no place I'd rather be

   Than with You,
           C
   Face to face.

2  Draw me this morning,
   Straight to Your word,
   Draw me this morning,
   Speak 'til I've heard.
   Lord, release what's within You,
   What You want to say.
   Speak a word to supply me,
   To get through this day.
   You're the word that's within me
   Supplying me grace.
   For the rest of this day, Lord,
   Speak with me,
   Face to face.

(Hymns, #788)

             D             D7
1  When thou wakest in the morning
             G
   Ere thou tread’st the untried way
          D                Bm
   Of the lot that lies before thee
               E            A
   Through the coming busy day;
            D                D7
   Whether sunbeams promise brightness,
           G               Em
   Whether dim forebodings fall,
          D               A
   Be thy dawning glad or gloomy,
         G               D
   Go to Jesus, tell Him all.

2  In the calm of sweet communion
   Let thy daily work be done;
   In the peace of soul-outpouring
   Care be banished, patience won;
   And if earth with its enchantments
   Seek thy spirit to enthrall,
   Ere thou listen, ere thou answer,
   Turn to Jesus, tell Him all.

3  Then, as hour by hour glides by thee,
   Thou wilt blessed guidance know,
   Thine own burdens being lightened,
   Thou canst bear another’s woe;
   Thou canst help the weak ones onward,
   Thou canst raise up those that fall:
   But remember, while thou servest,
   Still tell Jesus, tell Him all.

4  And if weariness creeps o’er thee
   As the day wears to its close,
   Or if sudden fierce temptation
   Bring thee face to face with foes;
   In thy weakness, in thy peril,
   Raise to heaven a truthful call;
   Strength and calm for every crisis
   Come, in telling Jesus all.

   Abiding in You as a branch in the vine

2  A lover of Christ should be one
   Who is called by Him to be delivered
   From the self through his oneness
   With the cross,
   With the cross of Christ.

3  A lover of Christ should be one
   Who is called by Him to live in ascension
   As the new creation,
   Creation of God,
   In the resurrection of Christ.

4  A lover of Christ should be one
   Who’s called by Him more strongly
   To live within the veil, through His cross,
   After the lover’s
   Experience of His resurrection.

(Capo 2)

        D            D7       G       D
1  As a lily growing out of a bramble bush,
        D                    F#m
   As a bright star shining forth in
       E7      A
   the darkest night,
        D          D7              G   Em
   Is a story excellent bright and fragrant
        D      A         G        D
   Of Boaz and Ruth in a divine romance.

2  Ruth the Moabitess joined to
   God's holy elect.
   Boaz took care of her and
   Redeemed all her debt.
   First she gleaned from his land,
   Then got married to him;
   This is how she was joined to
   God's eternal plan.

              D7          G        D
     Lord, I love You and treasure You.
     D       Bm                E7      A
     Lord, I choose You and respond to You.
     D         D7          G            Em
     You're my everything, You're above all.
               D               A
     You're my Husband, and my rest,
            G   A  D
     And my all in all.

3  The eternal God entered and
   Stepped into time.
   For this He needed persons to
   Carry the line—
   Those who fulfilled His plan,
   To bring God into man,
   Bringing divinity into humanity.

4  In the universe this is the greatest event,
   That is Christ's incarnation—
   In His first advent.
   Ruth became an ancestress in this mystery—
   God and man to be mingled as one entity.

5  God had promised the seed of a
   Woman for man
   That would crush Satan's head and
   Redeem fallen man,
   To make God and man one,
   What a glory to Him!
   We are qualified now to partake of Him.

6  We are Moabites too, constituted with sin.
   We are under God's wrath and
   His condemnation.
   But through Christ's redemption,
   He's our portion we claim.
   In this organic union, we're married to Him.

New tune:

1  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
             A        F#m       E
   Thou hast won each love from me;
            F#m    D         A
   Who like Thee— so fair and comely?
            F#m     D         E

   Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
            A   E             D
   None can e'er compete with Thee!

2  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
   Gladly will I hear Thy call;
   Since Thy voice my heart hath entered,
   I from all things could but sever;
   Void are all my other seekings,
   Every pride hath disappeared.

3  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
   How can I still stubborn be?
   At Thy feet cast all my hard'nings,
   And return with songs and singings;
   'Tis my love to be Thy bondslave,
   'Tis my joy to Thee obey.

4  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
   Thy way only will I choose;
   Though in tears while I'm obeying,
   Yet I would not change my standing;
   All I long for is Thy pleasure,
   And the peace Thy love would bring.

5  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
   When Thy presence does depart,
   Seems the dawn has lost its traces,
   Hidden are my smiling faces;
   All I yearn for is Thy coming
   And Thy presence' sweet embrace.

6  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
   Can I tell it all to Thee?
   Thou my love and satisfaction,
   Thou my everlasting portion;
   Thou art all that I desire,
   Nothing else I would pursue.

7  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
   All I have I give to Thee;
   Who like Thee— so fair and comely?
   Who like Thee— so sweet and lovely?
   Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
   None can e'er compete with Thee!

          A       A7                 D
   Mingle now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.

2  Shining One— how clear the sky above me!
   Son of Man, I see Thee on the throne!
   Holy One, the flames of God consume me,
   Till my being glows with Thee alone.
   Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,
   All self-love and glory sank in shame;
   Now my heart its love and praises render,
   Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.

3  Precious Lord, my flask of alabaster
   Gladly now I break in love for Thee;
   I anoint Thy head, Beloved Master;
   Lord, behold, I’ve saved the best for Thee.
   Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee;
   Loving Thee, I’m deeply satisfied.
   Love outpoured from hidden depths within me,
   Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.

4  My Beloved, come on spices’ mountain;
   How I yearn to see Thee face to face.
   Drink, dear Lord, from my heart’s flowing
   fountain,
   Till I rest fore’er in Thine embrace.
   Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,
   But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;
   Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;
   Jesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.

        C      F        C
   Rise up, my love, my beautiful one,
            Am          Em
   And come away, for behold,
                 Dm
   The winter is past.
       F       G7       C
   The rain is over and gone.

   Flow’rs appear on the earth,
       C
   The time of singing has come,
           Am           Em     Dm
   And the voice of the turtle dove
      F    G7      C
   Is heard in our land.

        F        G7
   My Beloved is mine,
       Am   F
   And I am His,

   He who feeds the flocks among the lilies.
            F   Dm
   ‘Til the day breaks,
           E            Am
   And the shadows flee away,

   Come my beloved,

   Come my beloved!

   The winter is past,
       F       G7       C
   The rain is over and gone.

        G                 C
1  Lord Jesus Christ, our heart feels sweet
       G       Em       D
   Whene’er we think on Thee,
       G          G7    C        Am
   And long that to Thy presence dear
      G          D        G
   We soon might raptured be!

     D                            G
     Lord, like the pretty henna-flower,
        A                         D
     In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
       G      G7      C      Am
     Incomp’rable Thy beauty is,
       G         D         G
     Admires and loves our heart!

2  There is no music adequate
   Thy grace in full to praise,
   Nor there a heart which could enjoy
   Thy love in every phase.

3  Yet, what delights our heart the most
   Is not Thy love, Thy grace;
   But it is Thine own loving Self
   That satisfies always.

4  Oh, Thou art fairer than the fair,
   And sweeter than the sweet;
   Beside Thee, none in heaven or earth
   Our heart’s desire could meet.

   D                   A7
1  How could a country girl like me
   Bm                      F#
   Become Your match, Your bride to be?
   G                   D
   You're holy and You are divine,
            Em          A
   But I'm fallen and human.

   D                   A7
2  Without You Lord I have no chance
   Bm                 F#
   To be like You in this romance,
   G                        D
   But You chose me ere the world began—
      Em          A           D
   Nothing could change Your plan.

                   A     Bm
     This divine romance
                        F#   G
     Is My heart's deep plan.
                D
     I became a lowly man
        Em                A    D
     To court My country girl.

                     A    Bm
     Nothing could deter,
                    F#  G
     Nothing can alter,
                 D
     My eternal love for her.
          Em       A       D
     I'll gain My country girl.

3  No man or angel ever knew,
   This secret hidden deep in You,
   That You desired to be one with man,
   Before the world began.

4  Though sin came in to ruin me,
   Through Satan's scheme and subtlety,
   Nothing could break Your love for me
   To gain me totally.

5  As King of kings You became a man.
   You died for me, I’ve been redeemed.
   In resurrection made us queen
   To marry You my King.

6  From death You rose and entered me;
   I now possess Your divinity.
   In life and nature we're the same;
   Both human and divine.

     In Your love I'm drawn.
     To You I belong.
     I am not my own Lord.
     I'm Yours alone.

     By Your love I'm drawn.
     In Your name I'm charmed.
     And Your person captured me,
     For I've been kissed by Thee.

7  Lord, in this close sweet fellowship,
   Lord, be with me so intimate,
   So personal and affectionate,
   A sweet relationship.

8  Lord, daily change my inward being,
   Lord, all my heart possessing,
   In all my being transforming
   To be Your bride and queen.

   I'm a sinner that toucheth You,
   A woman not worthy to anoint You.

     But I love You! Jesus, I love You!
     You forgave me the most,
     Now I love You, Lord, the most.

   Let my glory without wipe them too.
   Let me kiss them where the nails would pierce.
   All my love, Lord, and glory,
   I'll waste on You.

     I love You! Jesus, I love You!
     All my glory and love
     I pour and waste on You.
     Receive my ointment, Lord.
     It’s all I have, dear Lord
     For You, most precious One,
     Because I love You.

   Drove me seeking satisfaction.

4  In this endless search for something new,
   All the time this cry was just for You.
   I was blind in trying many things
   ’Til I drank You as my living Spring.

5  Lord, You came and filled my inmost being.
   You’re the sweetest satisfaction.
   You’re the Spirit as my everything,
   Spirit in my spirit bubbling.

6  Thank You, Lord, for coming into me.
   Now You’re spreading in me constantly.
   Lord, You're making home in all my heart,
   As my treasure filling every part.

New tune:

1  Something every heart is loving:
   C             Em            F
   If not Jesus, none can rest;

2  Thus I cast the world behind me;
   Bm    G      Em          A

3  Bright with all eternal radiance
   Is the glory of Thy face;
   Thou art loving, sweet, and tender,
   Full of pity, full of grace.

4  When I hated, Thou didst love me,
   Shedd'st for me Thy precious blood;
   Still Thou lovest, lovest ever,
   Shall I not love Thee, my God?

5  Keep my heart still faithful to Thee,
   That my earthly life may be,
   But a shadow to that glory
   Of my hidden life in Thee.

   A               F#m    D              E
1  Lord, You are beloved, Fairest of the fair;
   A           F#m      D            E
   Altogether lovely, unrivaled beauty;
   D              A           D            A
   It’s You! Your presence, I long for and seek.
   E              F#m        D
   You’re the One in whom my heart delights,
       E
   So, I just love to tell You:

     A        D
     Jesus, I love You,
         A            D
     My treasure, You are.
     F#m                 E
     How could I choose anything
     A         D
     less than You?
          A          F#m
     Dear Lord, my inmost heart
            E            A
     You’ve captured and won.

2  Dead I was in sin, Lord,
   So lost without You.
   Helpless, wounded, weary,
   Rebellious, too.
   But Lord, You came!
   You would not let me go.
   The blood and water flowed from Your side,
   Constraining me to tell You:

3  Thank You Lord, You opened
   My blind eyes to see.
   I was lame, but now I can walk.
   You healed me!
   My leprosy, Lord, You cleansed all away.
   My ears were opened to hear Your voice,
   And now I follow You ‘cause:

4  Sometimes Lord, I’m drawn off
   By my selfish cares.
   And the world it draws me
   With glitter and glare.
   O Lord, You’ve trapped me.
   Don’t let me go.
   Kiss me and woo me, and win my heart,
   So, I will always tell You:

5  Keep my heart so soft,
   Lord, so open to You;
   It would be the good ground
   to bear fruit for You.
   Capture my friends, Lord, and
   Build us, I pray,
   Your Bride, we’d match You in every way,
   And, corporately we tell You:

     Jesus, come quickly,
     We’re waiting for You.
     We’re the virgins to You,
     So single and true.
     Forever and ever Your counterpart true.

   In relationship You must be the first—
   Have preeminence in me.

   C
1  There is a great myst’ry
              Em
   A romantic story,
               F
   For ages it was veiled,
                 C  G
   But now fully revealed;
                  C
   ‘Tis a romance divine
                  Em
   Of God and man in time;
                F
   Beyond understanding,
                      G
   Yet seen in God’s speaking.

                      C
     God fell in love with man.
                    Am
     For only God’s love can
                       F
     Make man just the same as He
                    G
     In life and in nature.
                  C
     We are His expression,

     His bride, His enlargement;

     Forever together,
                  C                G
     As living, insep’rable as one couple
            C
     Eternally.

2  Though He was rejected
   By men who were blinded;
   His love is constraining,
   His heart still unchanging;
   Thus He became a man
   With a definite plan;
   His name is called Jesus,
   And He came to seek us.

3  Though I have lived in sin,
   I now have been redeemed
   By Christ who died for me,
   Who was raised in glory.
   Now I am joined to Him,
   Together we’re living;
   I love to enjoy Him,
   For I’ve been forgiven.

4  His love is so tender,
   To Him I’ll surrender,
   His name’s full of savor
   I gladly call in prayer;
   His person’s so charming,
   My heart ever winning;
   I’ll hold back no longer,
   I’ll love Him forever.

   Drive out from thee the world,
   And then thy heart shall be
   Filled with the love of God,
   And holy like as He.

   Entered Thy fellowship of love we’ll be.

2  He’s my Beloved, I am His own love;
   He draweth me, pursue I after Him.
   Fragrant as myrrh, I’d hide Him in my heart;
   Beauteous as henna, I’d be clothed with Him.

3  Bathe in His love, and of His fatness taste,
   Lie on His breast,
   His sweetness there enjoy;
   His love the banner, His affection shown
   Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.

4  Oh, my Beloved’s mine, and I am His;
   I am a lily and my Shepherd He;
   May daybreak come, the shadows flee away,
   Him on the mountains as a hart I’d see.

5  Myrrh of the death with Him and
   frankincense,
   The resurrection, permeate my heart;
   North wind awake, and
   Let the south wind blow,
   Make my heart’s garden pleasure
   to His heart.

6  I’d be to Him a dove that’s undefiled,
   As a pure lily in His presence be,
   His, wholly His, the joy of all His joys,
   He wholly mine, the Song of songs to me.

7  Fair as the moon, conformed to Him I’d be,
   Clear as the sun, unto His stature grown;
   For my Beloved, all to please His heart,
   For my Beloved, that His life be shown.

8  Thou art my life, and I Thine image real;
   Love in such union is as death most strong,
   Ne’er can it be destroyed or e’er replaced
   Till Thou on spices mountains
   Come ere long.

   Oh, the joy of full salvation!
   Glory, glory to His name!

      D      DM7       Em      A
1  Father, I know that all my life
      D         Bm      Em A7
   Is portioned out for me,
           Em               F#m     G
   And the changes that are sure to come
     Gm     A       D  DM7
   I do not fear to see;
         Em       A     F#m     Bm
   But I ask Thee for a present mind
      Em     A        D
   Intent on pleasing Thee.

2  I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,
   Through constant watching wise,
   To meet the glad with joyful smiles,
   And to wipe the weeping eyes;
   And a heart at leisure from itself,
   To soothe and sympathize.

3  I would not have the restless will
   That hurries to and fro,
   Seeking for some great thing to do
   Or secret thing to know;
   I would be treated as a child,
   And guided where I go.

4  Wherever in the world I am,
   In whatso’er estate,
   I have a fellowship with hearts
   To keep and cultivate;
   And a work of lowly love to do
   For the Lord whom I wait.

5  So I ask Thee for the daily strength,
   To none that ask denied.
   And a mind to blend with outward life
   While keeping at Thy side;
   Content to fill a little space,
   If Thou be glorified.

6  There are briers besetting every path
   That call for patient care;
   There is a cross in every slot,
   And an earnest need for prayer;
   But a lowly heart that leans on Thee
   Is happy anywhere.

7  And if some things I do ask in
   My cup of blessing be,
   I would have my spirit filled the more
   With grateful love to Thee.
   More careful, not to serve Thee much,
   But to please Thee perfectly.

8  In a service which Thy will appoints
   There are no bonds for me;
   For my inmost heart is taught “the truth”
   That makes Thy children “free”
   And a life of self-renounced love
   Is a life of liberty.

Original tune:

2  Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,
   Bm               E        A
   Lovely things of time and sense;

     Crown Him now unrivaled King.

3  What has stripped the seeming beauty
   From the idols of the earth?
   Not a sense of right or duty,
   But the sight of peerless worth.

4  Not the crushing of those idols,
   With its bitter void and smart;
   But the beaming of His beauty,
   The unveiling of His heart.

5  Who extinguishes their taper
   Till they hail the rising sun?
   Who discards the garb of winter
   Till the summer has begun?

6  'Tis the look that melted Peter,
   'Tis that face that Stephen saw,
   'Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
   Can alone from idols draw:

7  Draw and win and fill completely,
   Till the cup o'erflow the brim;
   What have we to do with idols
   Who have companied with Him?

   Welling up in me each day.
   Even though I have not seen Him in
   Such an outward way—
   "Whom having not seen, I love,
   I love, oh so much.
   And by having His life, yes, I believe."

3  Day by day I look forward to
   That time I spend with You.
   Just as Mary poured her love out,
   O Lord, I would too.
   Grant me, Lord, a heart
   That's single and true.
   And a daily life that's living just by You.

4  So when daily I see trials
   And tribulations sore,
   May I put my trust in You, Lord,
   "For Christ has gone before"
   And open to Your living Word,
   Receiving faith—
   Reach me, Lord, with Your mercy
   and Your grace.

2  Many sit at Jesus' table,
   Few will fast with Him,
   When the sorrow-cup of anguish
   Trembles to the brim.
   Few watch with Him in the garden,
   Who have sung the hymn,
   Few watch with Him in the garden,
   Who have sung the hymn.

3  Many will confess His wisdom,
   Few embrace His shame.
   Many, should He smile upon them,
   Will His praise proclaim;
   Then, if for a while He leave them,
   They desert His name,
   Then, if for a while He leave them,
   They desert His name.

4  But the souls who love Him truly,
   Let woe come or bliss,
   These will count their dearest hearts' blood
   Not their own, but His.
   Saviour, Thou who thus hast loved me,
   Give me love like this,
   Saviour, Thou who thus hast loved me,
   Give me love like this.

3  Living for Jesus wherever I am,
   Doing each duty in His holy name;
   Willing to suffer affliction and loss,
   Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

4  Living for Jesus through earth’s little while,
   My dearest treasure, the light of His smile;
   Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
   Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.

     Now, my Lord, I must confess,

   To the Lord be drawn!
   Keep the “first love,” never leave it,
   Till the break of dawn.

3  Will you be an overcomer?
   On His life depend!
   Dare to suffer persecution,
   Faithful to the end.

4  Will you be an overcomer?
   Testimony bear!
   Keep away from false religion,
   “Hidden manna” share.

5  Will you be an overcomer,
   Simple, real, and pure?
   Overcome all evil mixture,
   Ruling pow’r secure.

6  Will you be an overcomer?
   Trust the living Lord!
   Keep your “garments” from the deadness,
   Win the life-reward.

7  Will you be an overcomer?
   Never lukewarm be,
   Ne’er content with what you’ve gotten,
   More you need to see.

8  Will you be an overcomer?
   Christ is calling still!
   Will you now be loyal to Him,
   His demand fulfil.

        D        D7          G           D
1  Lord Jesus, I long in Thy presence to live,
        D          Bm         D
   From morning to evening my one world
        A
   Thou art;
     D          D7          G         D
   O let not my heart be contented or rest

   When loving or seeking
        A              D
   What with Thee doth part.
        A
   Each moment, each day,
              E7            A
   Throughout suff'ring and pain,

   When nought in the world
            E7         A    A7
   Can give comfort or cheer,
        D           D7
   When sighing and weeping
     G         D
   Encompasses me,
         Bm           D
   Lord, still all my sighing
       A          D
   And wipe every tear.

2  Each time when I dream of the goodness of life,
   I pray Thee, dear Lord, that Thou in it may be;
   O do not allow me to choose by myself,
   Nor seek any pleasure that's other than Thee.
   Each night when alone in the stillness I lie,
   I pray Thee, Lord Jesus, that Thou wilt be near;
   Each morning ere dawn comes,
   While still in my sleep,
   Then whispering call me and open my ear.

3  Each time, Lord, when reading
   In Thy holy Word,
   I pray that Thy glory may shine on each line,
   That clearly I'll see what a Savior I have
   And how great salvation that
   Thou hast made mine.
   When helpless I come, Lord,
   To kneel at Thy throne,
   I pray Thee to hear me and grant me Thy grace;
   If thru my shortcomings
   Thou hear not my prayer,
   Withdraw not Thy presence,
   O hide not Thy face.

4  Each time when of heavenly blessing I think,
   O let my heart long to be raptured to Thee;
   My only hope here is Thy coming again,
   My only joy there, Lord, Thy presence will be.
   Lord, teach me each day in Thy presence to live,
   From morning to evening
   My one world Thou art;
   O let not my heart be contented or rest
   When loving or seeking what
   With Thee doth part.

   Girded, waiting Thy command;
   Underneath the yoke to labor
   Or be laid aside as planned.
   When restricted in pursuing,
   No disquiet will beset;
   Underneath Thy faithful dealing
   Not a murmur or regret.

4  Ever tender, quiet, restful,
   Inclinations put away,
   That Thou may for me choose freely
   As Thy finger points the way.
   Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
   For my very life art Thou;
   Thee I take to all my problems
   As the full solution now.

3  I know Thee even less;
   In doctrine, shallowly;
   True revelation lack
   Of Thy reality.

4  As for Thy life within,
   In darkness I mistake—
   If spirit or the flesh,
   One for the other take.

5  As for Thy way, O Lord,
   I often am not clear;
   I toward seclusion tend
   And from the pathway veer.

6  As for Thy will for me,
   I do not know it well;
   I substitute my own
   And often would rebel.

7  As for the church, I need
   Thy revelation more,
   The Body-life to know,
   Thy wisdom to explore.

8  I long to be unveiled,
   In everything made clear,
   No more to be deceived
   Or to my pride adhere.

   Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
   Thither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,
   And never to another fountain fly,
   But unto Thee.

7  Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,
   When on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,
   Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
   Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
   My soul shall sing.

        D                 D7
1  I’ve found a friend in Jesus,
        G             D
   He’s everything to me,
            Bm                            A7
   He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
       D             D7        G           D
   The Apple-tree of trees, in Him alone I see
         Bm
   All I need to cleanse and
   A7            D    D7
   make me fully whole.
      G
   In sorrow He’s my comfort,
      D
   In trouble He’s my stay,
      Bm                            A  A7
   He tells me every care on Him to roll:
            D             D7
   He’s the Apple-tree of trees,
       G                  D
   the Bright and Morning Star,
            Bm             A              D
   He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

2  He all my griefs has taken, and all my
   Sorrows borne;
   In temptation He’s my strong and mighty
   Tower;
   I’ve all for Him forsaken, and all my idols
   Torn
   From my heart, and now He keeps me by
   His power.
   Though all the world forsake me, and Satan
   Tempt me sore,
   Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal:
   He’s the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and
   Morning Star,
   He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

3  He’ll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake
   Me here,
   While I live by faith and do His blessed will;
   A wall of fire about me, I’ve nothing now to
   Fear,
   With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.
   Then sweeping up to glory to see His
   Blessed face,
   Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:
   He’s the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and
   Morning Star,
   He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

3  To the Lord, the Jew, the Greek and

   He is rich unto all men that call upon His
   name.
   O Lord Jesus, what a joy to call and really
   live;
   When breathing in Thy name, what pleasure
   Thou to us dost give.

4  In the God of our salvation we may take
   Delight,
   Calling on His name at all times, though in
   Bliss or blight.
   I will call upon His name as long as I shall
   Live,
   Because He has inclined His ear, and grace
   So full does give.

5  We will call upon the Lord, who’s worthy of
   our praise;
   Thus our grateful hearts in worship we to
   Him may raise.
   We are those who call upon His name in
   every place
   With all the saints who from a pure heart
   call and taste His grace.

   He is wonderful, wonderful.
   He is wonderful, wonderful.

   The name of Jesus!

   Darkness and death cannot remain;
          G                D              G-C-G
   For we call and get the Person of that name!

     G        C
     Touching Jesus

     One way to really touch Him,
             G
     Just believe
              D    D7     C  G
     When you call on His name.

2  Dear Lord Jesus with our tongues—
   We gladly confess Thy name,
   To the glory of the Father God above.
   For to us to speak Thy praise,
   Is the enjoyment of our days;
   Calling JESUS is to call the One we love!

1  All I have in Adam is but sin and death,
   D             G     A                 D
   I in Christ inherit life and righteousness;
   G                      C        Am
   When in flesh abiding, Adam I express,
   G               C                D   G
   But when in the spirit Christ is manifest.

2  When I am in Adam, though I may not sin,
   Unto death, a sinner, sentenced I have been;
   When in Christ I need not righteously to act,
   I’m already righteous, justified in fact.

3  In the flesh I need no effort to express
   Marks of Adam’s nature and its sinfulness;
   In the spirit I need not to strive or strain,
   I can live as He is and in spirit reign.

4  Thru my death with Christ, from Adam I am free,
   Thru my life with Christ, new life is given me!
   Minding not the flesh, old Adam cannot move,
   Minding just the spirit, life divine I prove.

5  Minding just the spirit is God’s saving way,
   Minding just the spirit, Christ we will display;
   Minding just the spirit, we can overcome,
   Minding just the spirit, we the race may run.

6  Minding just the spirit, we the cross will know,
   And His resurrection pow’r thru us will flow;
   Minding just the spirit, Christ will live thru me,
   And His life within will reach maturity.

7  In the spirit Christ is life and all to me,
   Strengthening and blessing all-inclusively;
   Living in the spirit, holiness I prove,
   And the triune God within my heart doth move.

1  Day 1, You came to me,
   F            C
   Brooding so tenderly.
   F            C
   You spoke a word to me,
   Dm             G
   And light did shine.
   F            C
   My darkness You effaced,
   F        C
   My emptiness replaced;
   F             Em     Am
   The gospel's light erased
   Dm  G       C
   My hist'ry vain.

2  Day 2, did come and go,
   But one thing I did know:
   Things earthly lost their glow;
   They're dead to me.
   The atmosphere– expanse
   Lifted my circumstance,
   That life may thus advance
   For growth in me.

3  Day 3, the land so dry
   Emerged from waters high.
   Grass, herbs, and trees did rise;
   Your life had sprung.
   My death You now recede.
   As life do rise in me;
   Rise more 'til there's no sea
   Within my being.

4  Day 4, the sun did shine
   With wings of healing light.
   The moon was shining, too,
   The church, my home.
   The saints as stars with light
   Shine midst this dark'ning night,
   Setting my feet aright
   To walk Your way.

5  Day 5, the fish arrived
   Against the worldly tide.
   Death waters they survived,
   With life empow'red.
   From fish to bird I soar
   By waiting on You, Lord.
   Your grace to me affords
   Strength o'er all things.

6  Day 6, from air to ground,
   Cattle and beasts around,
   Then all creation crowned
   With man– like You.
   Through growth expressing Thee
   With Your authority,
   I'd reach maturity,
   Your purpose gained.

   Leave your sins behind, the race now run.

   Lord, may we know this grace and by it live,
   Thyself increasingly as grace to sense.

1  Breathing in the Lord is how we live today.
   Am              D
   Not by thinking do we live,
       D7               G
   But breathing is the way.

   We just call, “O Lord!”
                      C
   From very deep within,
   Am              D
   And with joy we testify
         D7              G
   We’re breathing in of Him.

     G
     Breathe in Christ, breathe in life,

     Breathe Him in today!
     C             G
     He’s our very life supply,
        A7                 D
     So breathe Him right away!
     G
     Breathe in Christ, breathe in life,

     Breathe Him in today!
     C             G
     He’s our very life supply,
         D                 G
     So breathe Him right away.

2  He’s so wonderful, the Breath of life is He.
   Once He simply was a man,
   But now He’s breath to me.
   He has changed His form;
   The Spirit now is He;
   He’s the Christ breathed out from God,
   The Breath breathed in by me.

     Everywhere, everywhere,
     Christ is life to me;
     I just call upon His name,
     And breath comes into me
     Everywhere, everywhere,
     Christ is life to me;
     I just call upon His name,
     And breath comes into me.

G - Em - Am - D (Repeat)
1  I’m coming again to this Fountain within;
   I’m opening wide to this life-giving tide.
   Here I am— coming to Him.
   Here I am— Lord come and flood me within.

2  I’m dry but I long to be swallowed by life;
   I’m weak but I’m coming and opening wide.
   Spring up well, spring up in me!
   Spring up well, unto eternity!

3  The wells of salvation are flowing and free.
   Thirsty or weary just open and see:
   They are free! Come and see!
   They are free! Open your mouth and you’ll see.

4  Zoe’s the answer and zoe’s the key;
   Zoe’s my goal and zoe’s my need.
   I need God’s life to flood o’er my soul;
   I need God’s life to fill me within and o’er flow.

5  I open a little and in comes the tide.
   The more that I drink, the more I’m satisfied.
   So I come–desperate for life.
   And I come–Lord, give me life or I die!

1  Morning dawn had arisen.
   C                D
   Abraham saddled his donkey,
   G                       Bm
   Took his two young men with him,

   And Isaac, his beloved son.

     Lord, You’re God’s only Son,

     “This is My beloved Son,

2  To his young men he said then,
   “Stay and we’ll return to you.”
   To Moriah he led him,
   His son Isaac– just them two.

     Just the son and the father,
     Speaking with one another.
     Isaac said, “My father!” Abraham
     Said, “Here I am.”

3  As You spoke with Your Father
   You bore the wood God laid on You.
   As a lamb to the slaughter,
   Obedient to the death were You.

     Precious blood of the Lamb,
     Slain before earth began,
     Laid Your life down for Your sheep, in love,
     That I might live.

4  Man of sorrows, I love You.
   From You men did hide their face.
   With no majesty to You,
   Despised, forsaken and disgraced.

     For my sins You were crushed.
     Lord, I love You so much.
     Chastened, scourged and then pierced
     through, my griefs
     And sorrows bore.

5  Dead in sins and offenses,
   I’m a bruised reed– smoking flax.
   Yet to death You were given,
   For of Your sheep, You’d not lose one.

     Like the woman, I'd weep,
     Flow my tears at Your feet.
     Jesus Lord, I just love You– dear Lord,
     Jesus my Lord.

   Now the uttermost;

   Once ‘twas what I wanted,
   Now what Jesus says;
   Once ‘twas constant asking,
   Now ‘tis ceaseless praise.

4  Once it was my working,
   His it hence shall be;
   Once I tried to use Him,
   Now He uses me;
   Once the pow’r I wanted,
   Now the Mighty One;
   Once for self I laboured,
   Now for Him alone.

5  Once I hoped in Jesus,
   Now I know He’s mine;
   Once my lamps were dying,
   Now they brightly shine;
   Once for death I waited,
   Now His coming hail;
   And my hopes are anchored
   Safe within the veil.

   Just love this precious Person.
   Forgetting and leaving all other things,
   Love Him with your whole being.

3  Christ now is my centre,
   And reality,
   My life for eternity.
   All things are just dung compared to Him,
   So love and just gain Him!

1  O glorious Christ, Savior mine,
             C               G
   Thou art truly radiance divine;
        D            G    Em
   God infinite, in eternity,
       A      A7      D       D7
   Yet man in time, finite to be.

         G                     D
     Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
         D7                   G
     Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
                 B7     Em  C
     God mingled with humanity
           G        D7     G
     Lives in me my all to be.

2  The fulness of God dwells in Thee;
   Thou dost manifest God’s glory;
   In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;
   As Spirit, oneness with me sought.

3  All things of the Father are Thine;
   All Thou art in Spirit is mine;
   The Spirit makes Thee real to me,
   That Thou experienced might be.

4  The Spirit of life causes Thee
   By Thy Word to transfer to me.
   Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,
   Thy life in me is thus conceived.

5  In spirit while gazing on Thee,
   As a glass reflecting Thy glory,
   Like to Thyself transformed I’ll be,
   That Thou might be expressed thru me.

6  In no other way could we be
   Sanctified and share Thy vict’ry;
   Thus only spiritual we’ll be
   And touch the life of glory.

7  Thy Spirit will me saturate
   Every part will God permeate,
   Deliv’ring me from the old man,
   With all saints building for His plan.

   This is far beyond emotion, mind, and will.
   It’s within our hidden part—
   Come, make home in all our heart;
   Let Your presence flow as rivers deep within.

   When fruits of life are expressed—
   Such virtues of— joy, peace,
   Faithfulness, love.
   Does my daily life pass the test?

3  When these virtues show—
   Others surely will know
   The beauty of life will shine.
   And the gospel word of life will be heard
   Bringing many to know life divine!

4  Lord grant me today, a new start in this way
   A person of life I would be—
   Just expressing You in all that I do
   Oh may this life flow out of me!

   G       Em                Am D
1  We have seen Christ is reality:
   G        Em              Am     D
   But it’s not sufficient just to see:
   G     G7         C
   He in our experience must be
   Bm            D
   Everything to us.
   G     Em                Am      D
   We in prayer behold Him face to face,
   G      Em                Am       D
   In the Word and meetings know His grace;
   G      G7             C
   But in daily life, in every place,
   Bm            D
   What is He to us?

     C
     Hallelujah! By His light we see
     Bm
     Oh, how real, how full our Lord will be
     Am
     If we’ll only turn to Him
              D
     At every time, in every day,
            D7
     Every thing, in every way and—
     G       Em          Am D
     Be specific for reality!
     G       Em             Am  D
     And be done with generality!
     G         G7              C
     If we’ll just apply Him, we will see
                D    D7 G
     He’s everything to us.

2  Life is full of opportunities
   Ordered by our Father’s hand: we see
   Everything’s the best that it could be,
   So let’s gain Christ!
   Christ our content and reality
   To shine out from us unceasingly:
   He must have a way in you and me,
   He must have a way.

     Hallelujah! In the Body we
     Bear the death of Christ continually:
     Thus His life comes forth for all to see as
     The outer man is broken down,
     The inner man is shining so that—
     In these earthen vessels men can see
     There’s the treasure of reality!
     Thus the gospel’s glorious light will be
     Shining out from us.

     Not just doctrines and theology,
     But the content of reality!
     Christ as everything in you and me,
     He’s everything to us!

   Bearing fruit a hundred-fold.

5  When my heart is like a rock so cold,
   It's Your word so strong that
   hammers stone,
   That the grain of life may come to me
   And supply me inwardly.

6  It's my food, my drink, and my life supply;
   I love to eat it every day and night.
   I just turn and open up to Him,
   And the rivers flow right in.

5  Christ is the resurrected King,
   Who died and rose, our life to bring,
   If you receive Him you will sing,
   And live forevermore.

     Yes, live forevermore!

   Just die on the cross in the way,
   Till the fulness of life from the Living One
   Is filling you day by day?

4  ’Tis the plan of life, for you die to live,
   One with Jesus crucified;
   With the life alone to be lived through you,
   Of the Risen, the Glorified.

   In my experience ever realize

   Self-life to the Cross must go.

     Through the Cross, O Lord I pray,
            G              A

             D
     Make me any price to pay,
     G    A         A7    D
     Full anointing to receive.

2  Christ, the Rock, must first be smitten,
   That the living water flow;
   Without death the Spirit's fullness
   Ne'er could dwell in man below.
   If with Christ we die completely,
   Willing thus our all to lose,
   He will clothe us with His power
   And to win the world will use.

3  First the altar, then the fire,
   If no loss, there'll be no gain;
   If our all has not been offered,
   To the throne we'll ne'er attain.
   If to sacrifice we're willing,
   All forsaking, God t'obey,
   He to us will be committed
   And thru us His pow'r display.

4  First we must prepare the vessels
   That the Oil they may contain;
   Dig the valley full of ditches
   That they may be filled with Rain.
   First we must go thru the Jordan
   Ere anointed from above;
   First in death we must be baptized,
   Then experience the Dove.

5  When we see the ripened harvest
   Of the golden countryside,
   We may know that many seeds have
   Fallen to the earth and died.
   Ere the fruit of life may blossom,
   We must surely suffer death;
   If with Christ we've not been buried,
   We'll not feel the Spirit's breath.

6  Since it must be thus, I pray, Lord,
   Help me go the narrow way;
   Deal with pride and make me willing
   Thus to suffer, Thee t'obey.
   I for greater power pray not,
   Deeper death is what I need;
   All the meaning of the Cross, Lord,
   Work in me— for this I plead.

   O Lord, move in; my mind, emotion, will

   That it may be Thy home in every way,
   A place for Thee to come and settle down,
   And all Thy grand recovery work to crown
   In one new man.

   Just rest, He knows;
   My soul, don't waste the present
   On those "what-if's".
   Just turn to Him and rest!

4  Just seek, He knows;
   Seek first His heart's great yearning.
   Just seek, He knows;
   Serve Him, in Him abide.
   Just seek, He knows;
   Have peace and rest while turning.
   Put His cares first;
   All else He will provide.

   Bm           G                     D  A
1  God hath not promised skies always blue,
   Bm            G
   Flower-strewn pathways
                  D    A
   All our lives through;
   Bm            G                   D-A-G
   God hath not promised sun without rain,
               D     A               G  D
   Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.

     C             G
     But God hath promised
                      D
     Strength for the day,

     Rest for the labor, light for the way,
     F#m             G                 D A G
     Grace for the trials, help from above,
                D      A         G  D
     Unfailing sympathy, undying love.

2  God hath not promised we shall not know
   Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;
   He hath not told us we shall not bear
   Many a burden, many a care.

3  God hath not promised
   smooth roads and wide,
   Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;
   Never a mountain, rocky and steep,
   Never a river, turbid and deep.

   Thy wings shall my petition bear
   To Him whose truth and faithfulness
   Engage the waiting soul to bless.
   And since He bids me seek His face,
   Believe His Word and trust His grace,
   I’ll cast on Him my every care,
   And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

4  Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of prayer!
   May I thy consolation share,
   Till, from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height,
   I view the promised land in sight:
   This robe of flesh I’ll drop and rise
   To seize the everlasting prize;
   The city of the promise, fair,
   And shout, “Farewell, sweet hour of prayer!”

3  O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
   When sickness upon us is stealing,
   No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,
   For joy is the fountain of healing.

       G               C
   God kindly veils my eyes,

   And o’er each step of my onward way
      C                   G
   He makes new scenes to rise;

   And every joy He sends me comes
     D                 G7
   A sweet and glad surprise.

           C
     Where He may lead I’ll follow,
        F              G
     My trust in Him repose;
         C     G       C
     And every hour in perfect peace,
          F         G
     I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows”;
         Am    G       C       Am
     And every hour in perfect peace,
          F         G         C

   ’Tis all I need to see,

   The light of heaven more brightly shines
        A                 D
   When earth’s illusions flee;
               F#m                 G
   And sweetly through the silence comes,
       A                 D
   His loving, “Trust in Me!”

     D            A         Bm    G
     Where He may lead I’ll follow,
     D           A     Bm   G
     My trust in Him repose;
     D         A       Bm
     And every hour in perfect peace,

       G            A         D
     I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows.”

3  Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,
   ’Tis blessed not to know;
   He holds me with His own right hand,
   And will not let me go,
   And lulls my troubled soul to rest
   In Him who loves me so.

4  So on I go not knowing;
   I would not if I might;
   I’d rather walk in the dark with God
   Than go alone in the light;
   I’d rather walk by faith with Him
   Than go alone by sight.

   And it seems
   That nothing’s changing outwardly.
   No, I’m not discouraged—
   I’m believing You.

3  Yes, I believe,
   And there is no demand on me.
   Simple faith—
   Yes, that is all You want from me.
   Freed from anxious doubting, Lord,
   I’m free to just believe.

4  Believing You,
   Because, Lord, You are my success.
   When I fail, all I must do is just confess
   And go on enjoying You.
     G         A   D
   I love believing You!

1  Loved with everlasting love,

New tune:

2  Heaven above is softer blue,

   I am His, and He is mine.

3  Things that once were wild alarms
   Cannot now disturb my rest;
   Closed in everlasting arms,
   Pillowed on the loving breast.
   Oh, to lie forever here,
   Doubt and care and self resign,
   While He whispers in my ear,
   I am His, and He is mine.

4  His forever, only His:
   Who the Lord and me shall part?
   Ah, with what a rest of bliss
   Christ can fill the loving heart.
   Heaven and earth may fade and flee,
   Firstborn light in gloom decline;
   But, while God and I shall be,
   I am His, and He is mine.

New tune 1: Repeat last half line

3  No matter if the way be sometimes dark,

   New Jerusalem descending,

     resting in the joy of what Thou art;

     I am finding out the greatness
                   D
     Of Thy loving heart.

2  Oh, how great Thy loving kindness,
   Vaster, broader than the sea:
   Oh, how marvellous Thy goodness,
   Lavished all on me!
   Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,
   Know what wealth of grace is Thine,
   Know Thy certainty of promise,
   And have made it mine.

3  Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
   I behold Thee as Thou art,
   And Thy love, so pure, so changeless,
   Satisfies my heart,
   Satisfies its deepest longings,
   Meets, supplies its every need,
   Compasseth me round with blessings,
   Thine is love indeed.

4  Ever lift Thy face upon me,
   As I work and wait for Thee;
   Resting ‘neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,
   Earth’s dark shadows flee.
   Brightness of my Father’s glory,
   Sunshine of my Father’s face,
   Keep me ever trusting, resting,
   Fill me with Thy grace.

2  There is always something over,
   When we, from the Father’s hand,
   Take our portion with thanksgiving,
   Praising for the things He planned.
   Satisfaction, full and deepening,
   All our need He doth supply,
   When the heart has tasted Jesus
   Its desires to satisfy,
   When the heart has tasted Jesus
   Its desires to satisfy.

3  There is always something over,
   When we share in all His love;
   Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,
   Unscaled heights rise far above.
   Human lips can never utter
   All His wondrous tenderness.
   We can only praise and wonder
   And His Name forever bless,
   We can only praise and wonder
   And His Name forever bless.

1  I’ve found the One of peerless worth,
      G7                  C
   My heart doth sing for joy;
       C      C7        F        C
   And sing I must, for Christ I have:
       Dm     G7          C
   Oh, what a Christ have I!

2  My Christ, He is the Lamb of God,
   Who full salvation brings;
   He is the Sun of Righteousness,
   With healing in His wings.

3  My Christ, He is the Tree of Life
   With fruit abundant, sweet;
   My hunger He doth satisfy;
   Of Him I daily eat.

4  My Christ, He is the smitten Rock
   Whence living waters burst;
   He is the fountain in my heart
   Which quenches all my thirst.

5  Christ is my life, my light, my way,
   My comfort and my health,
   My peace, my rest, my joy, my hope,
   My glory and my wealth.

6  Christ is my wisdom and my pow’r,
   My boast and righteousness,
   My vict’ry and redemption sure,
   My truth and holiness.

7  Christ is my Savior, Shepherd, Lord,
   My Advocate above,
   My Counsellor, my Father, God,
   My Brother, Friend, and Love.

8  Christ is my Captain and my Guard,
   My Teacher and my Guide,
   My Bridegroom, Master and my Head;
   In me doth He reside.

9  Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
   My Prophet full of sight;
   My Priest that stands ‘twixt me and God,
   My King that rules with might.

10 Christ is the Author of my faith,
   And its Perfecter too,
   My Mediator, Guarantee,
   And faithful Witness true.

11 Christ is my everlasting home,
   My all-sufficient land;
   My fortress, tower, hiding-place,
   And my eternal stand.

12 Christ is my sabbath and new moon,
   My morning and my day,
   My age and my eternity
   That ne’er will pass away.

13 Christ is my trust and my desire,
   In comeliness replete,
   My satisfaction and delight,
   Who all my need doth meet.

14 My Christ, the all-inclusive One,
   My Christ what shall I call?
   He is the first, He is the last,
   My Christ is All in all.

15 Since such a treasure I possess,
   My heart doth sing for joy;
   And I must sing, and sing again;
   Oh, what a Christ have I!

1  To Jesus every day we find
       C                  G
   Our hearts are closer drawn;

      C                 G
   In fairest words and more,

   And every day He’s dearer than

     He ever was before!

2  His glory broke upon us
   When we saw Him in the church,
   For here are all His riches,
   Here we’ve given up our search;
   ’Tis here He satisfies
   Our longing spirits o’er and o’er,
   And every day He’s dearer
   Than He was the day before.

3  Now He’s the living Spirit who
   Within our spirit dwells,
   And by His sweet anointing,
   How His life within us swells!
   As with the saints we’re meeting,
   Full released our spirits soar,
   For now our Lord is dearer
   Than He ever was before.

4  The Lord has made us one
   With Him for His recovery;
   The riches of this Christ, the church
   His fullness, men must see.
   Yes, all we have and all we are,
   We every day outpour
   For His tremendous purpose,
   Ever dearer than before.

# Luke 22:31-32

          C
1  At the end of Luke’s gospel,
           C7
   Chapter twenty and two,
       F            C
   The Lord says to Peter,
          D7            G
   “Satan wants to sift you,”
           C
   But the Lord’s interceding
           C7        F
   And His prayer is true,
                    C
   Hallelujah! He’s prayed for us,
         G            C
   We’ll never sift through!


     Though there’s all kinds of battles

     In our living each day,

     And we always face trials,
             D7           G7
     Life is ordered that way,
               C                      C7   F
     Still, in all situations, as He intercedes,
                         C
     He in all things supplies us
               G          C
     And meets all of our needs.

2  Just a Christian alone,
   However strong he may be
   Cannot withstand the sifting of the Lord’s
   enemy;
   Though he might sift one only, yet he’ll
   ne’er sift two!
   Hallelujah! Together we’re too big to sift
   through!

3  What a wonderful purpose
   God has purposed for us,
   To be transformed and reigning with His
   Son, glorious;
   So it just doesn’t matter what the foe might
   do—
   Hallelujah! The church is much too big to
   sift through!

   When we pray; read the Word;
   By our spirit touch the Lord,
   And God is pleased.

   God is pleased…

     But also our own souls,
     Because you became beloved to us."

   Come again with rejoicing,
   Come again with rejoicing,
   Bringing his sheaves with him.

     The Lord hath done great things for us;

       G             D
1  The faith is the economy,

   The economy of God,
       G                D
   The household administration,
          Em             C
   The dispensing of our God.

   The truth is the contents,
         Em           C
   The reality of the faith,
     G          D          C-D
   According to God’s economy.

          G                        D
     Godliness is a living that expresses the
       C         G
     Divine reality;
                                      D
     An expression of God in all His riches,
             C         G
     Full of all gravity.

2  Healthy teaching, words, and speaking
   Are the ministry of the truth,
   Ministering into people
   The reality of these truths.
   Eternal life is the means
   And the power to carry out
   The divine realities of the faith.

3  Faith is the response
   To the truth of the faith.
   Conscience is a test and a check
   To preserve us in the faith.
   The faith is the economy,
   The economy of God,
   The household administration,
   The dispensing of our God.

4  The faith, the truth,
   Expressed in healthy words,
   Carried out in power by His life,
   Expressed in godly living,
   Responded to by faith,
   Kept and held in check
   By our conscience.

   We're so glad to find the way
   To experience the Triune God
   And live by Him today—
   Get into the mingled spirit,
   And within the spirit stay;
   Yes, mingling is the way.

4  In the midst of seven lampstands,
   Now the Son of Man we see;
   Eyes ablaze and feet a'burning,
   He's for God's recovery.
   God's intention He's accomplishing—
   A corporate entity;
   Yes, mingling is the way.

5  In our daily life and all we are
   And do and think and say,
   How we need a deeper mingling
   Just to gain the Lord each day;
   Lord, we give ourselves completely
   Just to take the mingled way.
   Yes, mingling is the way.

6  From the fruit of daily living,
   New Jerusalem we'll see,
   It's the ultimate in mingling—
   it's divine humanity.
   And what joy that we can share it all,
   And share it corporately.
   Yes, mingling is the way.

2  The Son with the Father by the Spirit,
   Conceived in a virgin’s womb—
   The issue: a God-man, a wonderful Person,
   Jesus divine and human.

     Wonderful One, Son with the Father,
     Wonderful One, Son by the Spirit,
     Wonderful Jesus Christ,
     Wonderful Triune, wonderful Triune God!

3  This man in perfection chose God as His living;
   He lived the life of God.
   The sin, world, and Satan could not
   penetrate Him;
   Jesus had sinless blood.

     Humanity, His blood has cleansed me.
     Divinity, my guarantee.
     His sinless blood cleansed me.
     God’s now my guaran–,
     God’s now my guarantee.

4  His flesh without sin joined man’s flesh
   full of sin,
   And this trapped Satan.
   Man’s flesh, sin, and Satan were hanging
   upon Him—
   Oh, what a termination!

     Terminating, the old creation,
     Nullifying, flesh, sin, and Satan.
     Oh, what a promised seed!
     He crushed the devil’s;
     He crushed the devil’s;
     He crushed the devil’s head.

5  And in resurrection, this wonderful Person—
   The Spirit He became.
   The Spirit right now is the Son with the
   Father
   To be the consummation.

     Wonderful One, life-giving Spirit!
     Son has become the consummation.
     Son with the Father, He
     As Spirit dwells in, as Spirit dwells in me.

6  And in His ascension, this wonderful
   Person,
   This man is on God’s throne.
   The highest position, to Him it was given;
   He’s ruling and reigning.

     As Lord of lords and King of kings,
     The highest name to Jesus given.
     This man is on God’s throne.
     Most wonderful, most wonderful Person!

7  And in His enthronement as Head over all
   things,
   The processed God is He.
   Dispensing Himself as the life-giving Spirit,
   Producing His Body.

     The Triune God is not for doctrine.
     The Trinity is for dispensing.
     He’s now dispensing,
     And we’re enjoying, and we’re enjoying,
     And we’re enjoying Him.

1  We see a picture of the Triune God

   In Revelation 1:
   D              D7
   The lampstands golden
   G   C      G
   Shining so brightly.
                         C      G
   God the Father’s seen in the gold;

   The form shows us the Son;
    Am               D         G-C-G
   Shining Spirit is seven yet one.

         G7     C
     Now in our spirit we can see
                G
     The Triune God is all we need;
              D             D7
     Mingling with us to produce
              G   G7
     His many sons;
                        C
     Shining forth with God eternally
            G             Em
     In the New Jerusalem we
             D               D7
     Will express the Triune God
            G  C G
     forevermore.

2  Another picture in John 15:
   A long green vine to see.
   With branches fruitfully
   Flowing out the Spirit; we
   Are well tended by the husbandman.
   Grafted into Christ the Son;
   Abiding in the Triune God.

3  The ultimate consummation:
   The New Jerusalem.
   A corporate entity
   Shining God in eternity.
   City’s gold, pearl and precious stone;
   Work of Father, Spirit, Son-
   With Him we’re forever one.

     To be free, overcoming spontaneously.

2  Yet this life though it frees,
   Is not meant for mere victory.
   God is full of intent
   And never could flow aimlessly.
   So this life has a totality,
   A consummate issue encompassing me.
   Life moves and life grows,
   Life shapes as it flows
   Now I share in this life’s destiny.
   Oh, I’ve got rivers of life,
   Flowing out of my innermost being!
   I’ve got rivers of life,

     God and man revealed to be
     Lamb, Wife, Spirit, and Bride.
     Come! Drink! And riverside,
     Grows the tree,
     Our enjoyment for eternity!

3  So I’ve no cause to frown
   As one who’s received this zoe.
   I know life runs its course
   And triumphs inevitably.
   I’m required just to stay in the flow,
   If I do the drinking
   Then God gives the growth.
   So there’s joy in my heart,
   And a spring in my step,
   And a smile on my face as I sing,
   Oh, I’ve got rivers of life,
   Flowing out of my innermost being!
   I’ve got rivers of life,
   Flowing out of my innermost being!

   By Thy life we all can go much higher—
   Higher let us go.

     Oh, higher yet we pray—
     Transform us every day—
     And richer in the flow;
     May Thy life be all we know.

3  Growing, growing, in us He is growing,
   More and more each day.
   Into all our living He is flowing—
   This is now His way.

     For growth, O Lord, we pray;
     Increase in us each day.
     It’s not enough to know;
     Now Thy life in us must grow.

4  Living, living, Christ is all our living,

     Make home in all our heart.
     As life in every way
     Be our Person, Lord, each day.

6  Churches, churches, in the local churches
   We all find the flow:
   Deeper, higher, Christ as all our living,
   For the church we grow.

     The churches are today
     Just Christ in every way.
     For this, from self we cease,
     For Thy Body, Thine increase.

7  Building, building, we will see the building
   Of the church this way:
   Christ experienced will produce the building
   He’s the only way.

     Oh, build us, Lord, we pray,
     By growth of life each day.
     Oh, make us now such men
     For the new Jerusalem.

8  Coming, coming, Jesus soon is coming
   For His chosen Bride.
   In the churches we are all preparing
   To be glorified.

     Lord Jesus, come again—
     This cry is deep within.

   But a garden where our Lord
   Can plant and sow.
   So He's placed us all here corporately
   To be His garden fair,
   Where He's free to cultivate
   And make us grow.

3  Thus within the church-life garden
   There's a fruit-producing tree
   Full of life and so available to eat.
   So be simple, don't be hardened,
   Drop your concepts—eat that tree!
   Take in Jesus every moment—He's so sweet!

4  With the tree there is the water,
   Flowing God in Christ to us,
   Quenching all our dryness,
   Ending all our strife.
   Hallelujah! In His garden
   Jesus flows Himself to us,
   As the full supply for us to grow in life.

5  Aren't you satisfied and thankful
   That our Lord has brought you in
   Where His pleasures and His riches
   Flow so free?
   So be happy and be joyful,
   In the spirit feast on Him,
   So God's garden can bear fruit abundantly.

   Just eating and drinking,
   It’s what we do the best,
   Delighting in the love of the Lord.

3  We’re walking, not running,
   ‘Cause we’re in the pasture land.
   Our Shepherd is nearby,
   We’re trusting in His hand.
   He’s everything to us,
   He’s all we ever need,
   Resting in the peace of the Lord.

1  Let's take the land!

   The land that God has given us;
      D                                D7
   In all our living, Christ can be so much:
      G
   To take this land,
      C
   We have th' equipment that we need—
       G          Em
   The blood, the Word,
       D               G
   The Spirit, and the church.

     Sisters:

     Let's take the land! O Christian brothers,
                                 Am
     The land that God has given us.
                   D                   D7
     Be strong and take it, for we can make it
                                G   D
     And gain this land so glorious!

     Brothers:
                    G
     Let's take the land! O Christian sisters,
                              G7      C
     And to these things give earnest heed.

     The Lord implores us;
                 G
     He's gone before us
               C    D        G
     And given everything we need!

2  We have the blood!
   Christ is our spotless offering,
   Who gave Himself, our God to satisfy;
   And so we come with boldness
   To the throne of grace,
   And all day long, the precious blood apply.

3  We have the Word!
   The written Word's our daily food;
   We mix this Word with faith and say "Amen!"
   Then thro' the day,
   The spoken Word will speak to us
   And regulate our living from within.

4  The Spirit's ours! The Spirit of reality,
   He's independent of the way we feel;
   He dwells in us, and
   Teaches us to dwell in Him,
   And guides us into everything that's real.

5  We have the church!
   All saints are needed to possess
   The fullness of this vast reality;
   Together we will gain
   This all-inclusive Christ,
   And He to us our everything will be.

1  Once by nature we were dead in sin,

   In a world of utter discord;
   G     G7     C                 G
   But together God has quickened us,
             Em          D7              G
   Raised us up to sit together with the Lord.

     Jesus is getting us together,
     G         Em      A               D7

     To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

2  Thus with all saints we can apprehend
   All the vast dimensions of God.
   Knowing Christ’s love passes all we know,
   We’re together filled to fullness with our God.

3  Now we know the purpose of our God,
   Visible the mystery became:
   Christ, the church, together now we see,
   And together put the enemy to shame.

4  For this cause we pray the Father God
   Strengthen Thou with might our inner man;
   Make Yourself at home in all our hearts,
   Root us, ground us in Your love and for
   Your plan.

5  In the Body we’ll be fitly framed
   As the many members Christ supply;
   Working in the measure of each part,
   All by growth in love the Body edify.

6  Now we’re one His purpose to fulfill,
   As the one new man of His plan.
   Unto Him be glory in the church,
   And in Jesus Christ forevermore— Amen!

   Here all the sheep dwell securely,
   Kept by His presence so dear.

4  At the closing of this age,
   Just before Your kingdom's dawn,
   May You gain a people, Lord,
   For Your dwelling place, Your home.
   Since for me You gave Your all,
   Everything I lay aside;
   For Your church my all I'd give,
   That You would be satisfied.

6  The center and reality,
   The atmosphere and ministry,
   Of all our meetings is that we
   May thus exhibit Christ.

7  The testimony and the prayer,
   And all the fellowship we share,
   The exercise of gifts, whate’er,
   Should just exhibit Christ.

8  The Father we would glorify,
   Exalting Christ the Son, thereby
   The meeting’s purpose satisfy
   That we exhibit Christ.

(Capo 2)

   D
1  We have an inner life;
   G
   That’s for our daily life;
   D              Bm                 A      A7
   That’s for the meeting life— just Christ!
   D
   We’ll live the inner life;
   G
   We’ll have the daily life;
   D             Bm
   We’ll see the meeting life—
          A        D
   That’s just the church.

2  Christ is our inner life;
   He’s in our spirit now;
   Not far away from us— He’s right inside!
   And as we turn to Him
   And take Him as our all
   He will become in us our inner life.

3  Out from our inner life
   Will come our daily life,
   And all our living be filled up with Christ.
   Then as we live by Him,
   He lives His life in us,
   And He becomes to us our daily life.

4  The real experience of Christ in daily life,
   Will fill the meeting life with Christ Himself.
   Not empty forms and such,
   But Christ will be so much;
   And we will see Him here as
   The meeting life.

5  Without the inner life there is no daily life,
   There is no meeting life, there is no church!
   Christ as our inner life,
   Christ in our daily life
   Will make the meeting life new and glorious!

     How our praises then will swell,
            D  D7      G-C-G
     In the New Jerusalem.

2  As a pilgrim here I wander;
   While afflicted, I rejoice,
   For a better land I soon expect to see;
   Though all others seek for earthly gain,
   The holy city e’er
   Will my aspiration be.

3  Though my feet are often wearied
   On the rough and rugged path,
   Just by thinking of that city, I’m restored;
   Though my eyes be filled with tears,
   My heart will evermore be fixed
   On that city, my reward.

4  With strong purpose I now wrestle;
   And I run toward the goal;
   I pursue the prize, God’s highest to obtain;
   Pressing forward toward the mark,
   I run forgetting all behind,
   Thus the holy city gain.

   Set the way for us to follow,
   He denied His natural man and

   Once He was the only God-man;
   Now we are His duplication.
   As the many grains we’re blended
   As His corporate reproduction.

3  Living out His resurrection,
   Dying to the flesh and soul-life,
   Living by the mingled spirit,
   Natural man we will deny.
   Now we’re living in the Body,
   Every day we’re overcoming,
   Striving for the peak of Zion,
   Watching for our Lord’s appearing.

4  God and man will have one living
   Always in the mingled spirit;
   We two are incorporated
   One organic entity.
   This the vision of the ages
   Will control our daily living,
   That the Lord may have His Body
   Shining as the holy city.

(Hymns, #1325)

New tune:

   D     A     Bm    A
1  God eternal has a purpose,
   D         A    Bm     A
   Formed in His eternal past,
   D          A  G       A
   Spreading to eternal future;
   D            A        G       A
   'Twixt these ends all time is cast.
   G                          D
   For with time there is the process,
   G                      D
   Time for His accomplishment;
   G                        D
   And in time we're merely travellers—
   G                  D
   For eternity we're meant.

Original tune:
   D                A        Bm
2  God would have a group of people
   Em      G       A     D
   Built together in His plan,
                    A   Bm
   Blended, knit, coordinated
   Em     G      A7      D
   As His vessel—one new man.
             G       D      G
   God would come into this vessel
            Em      G        A
   With His nature, life and ways,
   D               A         Bm
   Mingling Spirit with our spirits
   G                A     D
   For His joy and to His praise.

3  God has worked in three directions
   For His plan so marvelous:
   As the Father, Son, and Spirit
   To dispense Himself to us!
   All creation gives the setting—
   Heav'n and earth are for this plan;
   'Tis for this God made a body,
   Soul and spirit—three-part man.

4  As the center, as the kernel,
   Of God's plan our spirit is;
   Calling on the name of Jesus
   Makes our spirit one with His.
   From the center to circumference
   God would saturate each part;
   Feeling, mind, and will renewing,
   Making home in all our heart.

5  Thus in life we're built together,
   Then in love we're knit as one;
   God is now His plan fulfilling,
   Finishing what He's begun.
   Lord, increase Thyself within us
   That we might be built by Thee
   Into that great corporate vessel
   Filled with God exclusively.

6  As the product, the fulfilment,
   Will the church in glory stand,
   Consummation of the purpose
   In eternal ages planned.
   God will have His corporate vessel,
   All His glory to contain;
   Lord, we're wholly for Thy purpose
   All Thy goal in us attain.

       D          Bm
1  The Bible is a romance
          Em         A
   In the most holy sense;
           F#m        Bm
   God and His chosen people
      Em            A
   In love it so presents.
        G         D
   This universal couple

          G       D     A
   Throughout it is displayed
       Bm               G
   God in Christ is the Bridegroom,
       Em          A          D
   His saints, the bride, portrayed.

2  Through shadows, types and figures,
   God's deepest thought is known;
   As typified by Adam,
   The Husband, Christ, is shown.
   A rib brought forth from Adam
   Reveals the source of life
   By which God built a woman:
   Eve, as the church, His wife.

3  To be His people's Husband,
   To take them as His wife:
   This is what God desires
   To live in marriage life.
   Their sacrifice and worship
   Alone could not content;
   But with them to be married
   Was God's foremost intent.

4  This romance is the finest
   As seen in Song of Songs;
   For her Beloved's kisses
   His seeking lover longs.
   Love's work in her produces
   No person of her own,
   But she becomes the city,
   Her person, Christ alone.

5  Christ is our coming Bridegroom;
   We are the church, His bride,
   Redeemed, regenerated,
   The issue of His side,
   In source, in life, in nature
   And person fully one,
   His counterpart forever,
   The New Jerusalem.

     Is here on earth before our eyes.

2  His Son, Jesus, is our Savior,
   Once in human form He came.
   Now as Spirit He can enter
   As the breath of life to man.
   As a seed within our spirit
   Christ takes root and starts to grow,
   Spreading in our inmost being
   Till His life we come to know.

3  Time is short, oh, brothers, hear it!
   Christ is longing for His Bride.
   We can hasten His returning
   Simply by the growth in life.
   No more struggling, no more striving,
   Simply turn to Christ within.
   See the seed begin to blossom,
   Growing fully into Him.

     Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
     By growing in a normal way.
     It's not an instant transformation;
     This growth goes on from day to day.
     The seed of life is all-inclusive.
     It's got everything we'll ever need.
     Yes, our God's eternal purpose
     Is all within this precious seed.

   A mutual dwelling place to be;

# Rev. 21:2, 9-11

    D                  A
1  According to the entire revelation of
   Bm           F#m
   The New Testament,
        G                   D
   The unique goal of the Christian work
          Em            G  A
   Should be the New Jerusalem
         D               G
   Which is the ultimate goal of
          D           A7
   God's eternal economy.
          G               A
   Which is the ultimate goal of
   G             A7   D
   God's eternal economy.

                          D7
2  The degradation of the church is
   G
   Mainly due to the fact
        E7
   That nearly all the Christian workers
           A
   Are distracted to take
        A7
   Many things other than the
   D         G            D
   New Jerusalem as their goal.
           Em                G
   Nearly all the Christian workers
          Em
   Are distracted to take
        G            D
   Many things other than the
         A       G        D
   New Jerusalem as their goal.

                         A             D
3  Hence, under the degradation of the church
      G
   To be an overcomer
                 D
   Answering the Lord's call
         A                  D
   Needs us to overcome not only

   The negative things
       A
   But even more the positive things
           G
   Which replace the New Jerusalem
          D
   As the goal.

      D           G           D
4  An overcomer's goal should be
                G
   Uniquely and ultimately
       D              A           D A
   The goal of God's eternal economy
       D           G           D
   An overcomer's goal should be
                G
   Uniquely and ultimately
       D              A           G
   The goal of God's eternal economy
                          D
   That is, the New Jerusalem.
        Em    A   G  D
   The New Jerusalem.

   (Chorus)

   We are pressed on every side (but not

   Unable to find a way out (still with a way

   Persecuted (but not abandoned),
   And cast down (but not destroyed).

   When we hold fast the Head, He freely flows.
   As we're daily enjoying, we with Christ are infused,
   All His heart for the Body we'll know.

   For the sake of Your Body, Lord, unveil our eyes,
   Deal with ‘self’, all the ground to You we give.
   Save us from independence and all natural ties.
   Blend us all in Your Body to live.

   One with Christ in His Body, in the rich supply,
   Every part causing growth in love each day.
   Thus God's purpose eternal will be realized—
   Christ expressed through His Body for aye.
   Thus God's purpose eternal will be realized—

   Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in

   Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in

   In my weaknesses
   That the power of Christ might tabernacle

   That the power of Christ might tabernacle
   over me.

Mercy’s Vessel

             D    G      F#m       Bm
   When this poor sinner stands at last
      G      D    A
   Perfected as a son,
        D         G       F#m  D
   I'll praise my God for many things
       G          A       D
   But most, what mercy's done.

         G        F#m     A       D
   While far from God and dead in sin,
        G     D    A
   Rich mercy did abound;
     G       D      A        D
   I did not ask or seek for God,
       G      A      D
   But yet my Lord I found.

   I'm mercy's vessel, this I know,
   For God has chosen me;
   The riches of His glory shall
   Thus manifested be.

   Not him who wills can follow now
   This way as yet unknown;
   Not him who runs can yet pursue,
   But to whom mercy's shown.

   My Father's lovingkindness 'tis,
   That I am not consumed—
   For His compassions never fail;
   Each morning they are new.

   Through His compassions day by day
   I give myself to be
   Transformed and built with other saints,
   Christ's Body thus to see.

3  Nothing between, like pride or station;
   Self-life or friends shall not intervene;
   Though it may cost me much tribulation,
   I am resolved; there's nothing between.

4  Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,
   Though the whole world against me convene;
   Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
   I'll triumph at last, with nothing between.

     The earth was once a bitter place
     Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
     Now joy’s begun within my soul,
     'Twill last while endless ages roll.

     What matters where on earth we dwell?
     On mountain top, or in the dell,
     In cottage, or a mansion fair,
     Where Jesus is, my joy is there.

Consecration

3  Lord, You are the only One who offered
   Yourself without reluctance unto God;
   Full obedience to the Father given
   Absolute, You sacrificed Your all.

4  As this One, You’re dwelling in my spirit
   Moving, spreading outward day by day;
   There's a whisper of Amen within me
   In response to all that You would say.

5  I say Yes and give You full permission
   To touch every corner of my heart;
   Break through all the barriers in my being
   Do not let me withhold any part.

6  'Tis my joy to give You all the ground, Lord,
   Make my heart a dwelling place for You;
   I want You to be at home within me
   Come and settle down in every room.

7  Lord, do cleanse my heart from all self-seeking
   That I'd truly want nothing but Thee;
   Let my soul be occupied, possessed, Lord,
   That You would be magnified in me.

   Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise
   When reigning in the Kingdom of Thy

   Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless

2001 Winter - Crystallization-Study of 1 & 2 Thessalonians & Song of Songs

   The dispensing of Christ
   is for the gradual building up of His Body
   and the transmitting of Christ
   is for the sudden raising up of God's
   churches.

   God's eternal intention
   is to head up all things in Christ,
   the universal Head,
   through the church,
   which is His Body.

   The oneness of the Spirit
   must be kept diligently
   by all the believers in Christ
   with the transformed human virtues
   strengthened and enriched
   by and with the divine attributes.

   As the unlimited, immeasurable
   Christ makes His home in our hearts,
   we are filled unto all the fullness of God -
   the ultimate, corporate expression of the
   Triune God.

   As my spirit burns, Satan cannot win!
   Calling, “Oh Lord Jesus,” keeps the flow

   In whom we have redemption
   through His blood
   And forgiveness the moment we believe.

# Lev. 1:4 footnote 4

   D                               G
1  Lord, I take You as my sin offering
              D
   for what I am,
       D                                G
   But Lord, I take You as my burnt offering
       A        D
   for what I’m not.
           D          G
   I’m not loving, submissive,
                     A
   patient, kind, or meek,
           D         G
   I’m not single in view, Lord,
                   A
   nor is it God I seek.
        D                   G          D
   But dearest Lord, You’re all these things,
                   A
   all virtue’s in You,
      D             G        D      A     D
   So Lord I lay my hands on You in all I do.

2  Lord, in me is all self-love, envy, anxiety
   Lord, in me is only pride and no humility.
   I’m not pure, Lord, or trusting,
   neither absolute
   For Your purpose, I waver—
   I’m not resolute!
   But dearest Lord, You’re all these things,
   all virtue’s in You,
   So Lord I lay my hands on You in all I do.

3  Such a laying on of hands is not for
   substitution;
   When we lay our hands on Christ,
   it brings in a union.
   By our laying our hands on Christ,
   we are joined to Him.
   We become one— no longer two—
   we become Him!
   In such a union all our weaknesses,
   wounds, and scars
   Are taken on by Him and
   His virtues become ours.

4  Such a union requires exercise through
   proper prayer
   We open our failures, defects
   for our Lord to bear.
   As we pray in this way, Christ—
   the One with no such sin
   E’en the life-giving Spirit
   immediately works within
   To live in us a life,
   a repetition of Christ our King,
   The One who lived on earth
   the life of the burnt offering.

5  Lord, You’re balanced, fine and pure
   and loving through and through
   You welcome the leprous ones,
   blind, lame all come to You.
   You have eyes of a dove, Lord—
   blemish free are You.
   No mixed motives, self-glory,
   what the Father says You do!
   Your humility’s unsurpassed—
   obedient e’en unto death.
   Trusting in the Father’s will,
   living by Him breath by breath!

6  Thus, I open up to You each failure,
   blemish, and spot.
   I want You to know me, Lord,
   and know all that I’m not.
   You’re my Husband, my strong One,
   I am just Your wife.
   Bear my burdens, my loved One,
   give me Your wonderful life!
   I take up this exchange,
   God Himself is what I’ve got.
   You can bear all that I am,
   You can be all that I’m not!
   You can bear all that I am,
   You can be all that I’m not!

1  I just realised dear Lord,

     O Lord.
                     G              A7
     I’d be found in You and You in me
              F#m            Bm
     living together constantly.
                   Em7         A7
     Enjoying each other mutually.
         G           A     Bm
     Oh this is Your recovery,
     G    A          D
     this meets Your need.

2  Draw me Lord, together with some others
   Who would run after You, and not another.
   Make us vital in Your life and purpose,
   Willing to know You, gain You,
   and to match You!
   Above all, dear Lord, Your need is greater
   Since You are the “I AM”—
   the ‘Great Creator’!
   Matchless One, our Lover,
   and our dear Bridegroom,
   Expecting to realise Your dream
   in all You have won!

   Sin and rebellion's in me and

   If You're willing, cleanse me.
   My destiny is to die; can You help me

   Lord, I know that You can.
   All others, Lord, run away when they come
   see my face,
   Helpless hopeless I am.

     Stretching out Your hand unto me,
     How my heart was warmed when You
     touched me
     With compassion; moved with love I

     By Your touch to me I'm healed.

3  I down to Jericho went, met my robbers
   who stripped me and left me half dead.
   The priests and levites 'cause they also
   travelled my way,
   Couldn't help me a bit.
   But, Lord, You came to the earth, despised
   and slandered;
   A Samaritan low,
   With divinity there and humanity's care,
   Tender and merciful.

     Bound my wounds and poured in oil and
     wine,
     Gave Your Spirit to me and life divine,
     To the church brought me where care
     I could receive,
     Jesus, You're my Savior true!

2  How blinded we have been,
   Shut in with what concerns us;
   While God's house lieth waste—
   Lord, break through, overturn us;
   We'll go up to the mountain,
   Bring wood and build the house;
   We'll never say, "Another day!"
   It's time! We'll come and build!

3  O Lord, against these days,
   Inspire some for Your building,
   Just as in David's day—
   A remnant who are willing
   To come and work in Your house,
   Oh, what a blessed charge!
   Your heart's desire, is our desire—
   We come, O Lord, to build.

4  Within those whom You'd call
   Put such a restless caring
   For building to give all—
   These times are for preparing;
   The gates of hell cannot prevail
   Against the builded Church!
   The hours are few, the builders too—
   Lord, build, O build in us!

   Open every, every part.
   And make Your heart's desire
   The desire of my heart.

     You're so attracting,
     Can't help but asking,
     “Make me a part
     Of the firstfruits
     To satisfy Your heart.”

# Heb. 4:15-16
(Capo 1)

# D - A - Bm - G (Repeat)
   For we do not have a High Priest
   Who cannot be touched with
   The feeling of our weaknesses,
   But One who has been tempted in all
   respects like us,
   Yet without sin, yet without sin.
   Let us therefore come forward
   With boldness to the throne of grace
   That we may receive mercy and find grace
   For timely help.

   D      A      G         A        D
   All I know is I want to see reality.

2  Lord, I'm sitting by...the road.

   Now, Lord, I hear that You...pass by.
   Lord, Son of David...I cry.
   Lord, Son of David, I cry.
   Please, Christ, don't pass me by.
   I believe that You can open my eyes.

3  You gave me life but where's...my sight?

   Blind lead the blind and then...both fall.
   So right now on You...I call.
   Jesus, have mercy on me.
   Open my eyes that I might see.
   All I know is my only hope is in You.

4  Lord, I am rebuked by...the crowd.
   For You I cry out more...the loud.
   All the world wants to di...stract me.
   So I forget that I...can't see.
   Jesus, don't leave me behind.
   You are the one I want to find.
   All I know is I just really need You.

5  Still I'm afraid that You'll...go on.
   But joyful ears hear You...respond.
   "What would you like for me...to do?"
   Oh Christ, I just want to...see You.
   Open my eyes to see You.
   Let me find what my spirit can do.
   All I know is I just want to see You.

6  In my spirit I...can see.
   Because that's where You...touch me.
   By Your touch, dear Lord,...I'm healed.
   All my sin and death...must yield.
   Now Lord, I am healed.
   In my spirit You are so real.
   All I know is I want to keep touching You.

7  Lord, my sight is for...one thing.
   So that I to You...can cling.
   I think I'm in love...with You.
   No one else for me...will do.
   Lord, Christ, let me follow You please.
   You're so real and so special to me.
   All I know is Lord, I never want to leave.

   Yearning earnestly for Your elect,
          Gm              C
   As for Israel so long ago,

2  Christ came as man as Your righteousness

   That in Your divine economy
   He Your people's everything might be;
   As our universality,
   And our centrality experienced.

3  Wicked by birth, deceitful, corrupt in heart,
   Our one hope: redemption from our fall,
   Wickedness and sin, but that's not all—
   The redemption of Christ and salvation
   By life divine dispensed to us.

4  Saved by Your life and Your life's capacity,
   We're renewed that You could be our God,
   And that we Your people all could be
   That we'd share the enjoyment of all
   Of the riches of the Trinity.

5  Isr'ael will be restored in the coming age;
   With Your overcomers they'll enjoy
   All Your riches, which will consummate
   In new earth and new heav'n
   For eternity in the New Jerusalem.

   "It is by My Spirit."
   I am faithless, You're faithful still,
   Your love is stronger than my will.

3  Your gracious gifts, Your holy calls
   are irrevocable.
   Though I am not but You are able
   From strength to strength, grace upon
   grace,
   Sustaining me to win the race.
   My life I give to You.
   "I will never leave you."
   My dreams and future, too.
   "Nor will I forsake you."
   Oh Lord I do! I do! I do!
   I love You Lord, I really do.

     He gave Himself up for Her.

   If it weren’t for the Body,

   O Lord, You care for our house!
   Oh, what a blessed word!
   As You're to God, You'd be to us—
   A mutual abode.

3  There's nothing that we are

   Inwrought into our being.
   O Lord, our heart's still vacant now!
   Come in and settle down.
   Come saturate and permeate
   And fill us with Yourself.

4  Our spirit You have filled
   At our regeneration,
   But mind, emotion, will
   Await Your saturation,
   How much of You is built in us
   To make our heart Your home?
   O Triune God, we welcome You.
   Come build, oh, build in us.

   Come, Lord, Yourself dispense
   By constant, fresh infusion;
   Transform us, Lord, and work Yourself,
   As God's embodiment,
   Into our heart, and life each part
   With Your reality.

6  To build Your house today,
   Self effort You're refusing—
   All stubble, wood, and hay;
   Gold, silver, gems You're using
   The consummated Triune God
   Transmitted into us,
   Now builds Himself into a home—
   His dwelling, glorious.

# Eph. 2:1, 3, 12, 14, 15

   D              G
1  I once was dead— dead in my sins;
   D         A
   Behaved myself in lust of flesh.
   D          G
   By nature, such a child of wrath,
   D    A      D
   Even as the rest.

2  But God being so merciful,
   Because of His great love to me—
   Enlivened me, I’m now with Christ,
   Seated in the heavenlies.

3  But that’s not all! I’m with the saints.
   Together we’re his workmanship,
   His masterpiece, expressing Him
   In the heavens and on earth.

   D                     G
4  I was once apart from Christ, you know.
   D                        A
   Alien from the wealth of Israel.
   D     D7             G
   Not a hope, not even one to tell.
   D       A          D
   Without God in the world.

5  Now in Christ He has become my peace.
   By the blood of Christ I am released.
   I am one with all the saints, since He’s
   Broken down the middle wall.

6  He has died creating one new man,
   Thus fulfilling God’s eternal plan.
   With all saints together let us stand;
   Shout and sing and praise the Lord!

# Jn. 20:1-17

1  I do not know where they have laid Him.
                           Em
   The stone is taken away from the tomb.

   Oh! They have taken Him away!

   Oh! Where is He?

2  Disciples came and saw the empty tomb
   But went away so soon to their own homes.
   Theyʼre satisfied with just the facts.
   But whereʼs my Lord?

     Jesus, my Love, I just want You.

3  My heart is broken from my deepest need.
   Don't ask me, angels, why I'm weeping.
   Nothing but Jesus fills my inner being.
   Oh! Where's my Love?

4  Someone is standing right behind me.
   It's just the gardener; I can barely see.
   Sir, if you carried Him away…
   Oh! Where is He?

     Where is He, my Jesus?
     Where is He, my Beloved?
     Tell me where you have laid Him
     And I'll carry Him away, I'll carry Him
     away.

5  And then I heard a voice say, “Mary.”
   That sweetest voice that penetrated me.
   It is the voice of my Beloved,
   Jesus, my Love.

     I have found my Jesus!
     I have found my Beloved!
     I have found whom my soul doth love,
     Jesus, my Love, I just love You!

6  But Jesus told me not to touch Him yet.
   He must ascend first to the Father,
   “And to My Father and your Father
   To My God and your God.”

     Go and tell My brothers,
     I ascend to the Father
     To My Father and your Father,
     And My God and your God;
     go tell My brothers.

2  Christ in the beginning
   Was the Word of God;
   As a living person
   Christ on earth did trod.
   As the Word Incarnate
   He is God defined,
   So that by His speaking
   Life and light men find.

3  Father, Son, and Spirit
   Is the Triune One;
   Mutually indwelling,
   Father in the Son;
   Enjoyed in the Spirit,
   Accessed through the Son,
   Unto God, the Father
   All are joined as one.

4  God by His dispensing,
   God's economy,
   Will fulfill His purpose
   In His trinity;
   From the loving Father,
   Through the Son as grace,
   In the mingled Spirit,
   Is His dwelling place.

5  Christ is all-inclusive,
   All-inheriting;
   Firstborn of creation,
   First in everything;
   Son of God effulgent,
   Bright, extensive, vast,
   Christ, High Priest and Builder,
   Is the First and Last.

6  Jesus Christ, the Spirit,
   All-inclusive cure,
   Is a compound ointment,
   Life-giving and pure;
   By His sweet anointing
   All are sanctified;
   For the church, the Spirit
   Is intensified.

7  Living in the Body,
   Body life is known,
   Living by the Spirit
   Christ is fully grown;
   By organic union
   Members cultivate
   Body-conscious living,
   Age to consummate.

8  See the Holy City,
   God's supernal goal,
   God's organic blueprint,
   His eternal scroll;
   Corporate reproduction,
   New Jerusalem,
   Bride of Christ presented;
   Worship, praise to Him.

2  Life is not created
   As man's body, soul, and spirit—
   That's man's life that's weak and temporal.
   Life is uncreated.
   It's divine and it's eternal.
   And this is the life that's indestructible.

3  And this life came in us
   In our spirit through the Spirit;
   This is where we were made alive!
   Now this life is spreading.
   Lord, don't stop— just keep invading.
   For this, Lord, we must be daily revived.

4  Life needs our maintaining,
   Otherwise we're suffocating.
   Calling on His name we breathe Him in.
   Everywhere we breathe Him,
   Makes us fresh and makes us living.
   O, this life is full of hope and meaning.

5  In our daily living
   It's this life that we are sensing.
   Are we in the flesh or in the Lord?
   If you're dead and empty
   And the troubles you have plenty,
   Saints, get out of there and flee back to the
   Lord!

6  Then you'll sense life flowing.
   It's this life that's overcoming
   Satan, flesh, and the world, and sin.
   What a life we're having.
   Lord, Your virtues manifesting,
   Thus, we're branches bearing fruit in John 15.

     Always there through rain or shine.
     There is a someone
     When there is no one;
     There is a someone, a special One.

3  Is there someone who will take
   Take me just as I am?
   A someone who’ll not forsake
   One I can trust to the end?
   A someone who knows me
   Yet he still wants me?
   There is no someone like this One.

     There is a someone
     Who will take you as you are.
     There is a someone;
     He will reach you near or far.
     There is a someone;
     He’s the most lovely One.
     Just take this someone, the loveliest One.

4  Is there someone who can reach
   Down to the depths of my being?
   A someone who can fix
   All of my broken heart strings?
   A someone who can love me
   When there’s no love in me?
   There is no someone like this One.

     There is a someone
     Who can touch your inmost being.
     There is a someone;
     He can make your heart to sing.
     There is a someone,
     Love is this precious One.
     Just love this someone,
     The wonderful One.

     Christ is this someone
     Who can touch your inmost being.
     Christ is this someone—
     He can make your heart to sing.
     Christ is this someone.
     Christ is this precious One.
     Just love this someone,
     The wonderful One.

   D             D7         G
1  From my spirit, when I’m sensing the supply
   A7       D       Bm       E7
   Of God’s speaking, from a fount that ne’er
        A7
   runs dry,
           D   D7        G
   And within me comes a fresh and sweet
      Em
   supply,
             D           A7           D - G - D
   Then I’ve got to open up and water you.

     A7    D
     Water you, water you,
              Em            G            A - A7
     From the flowing in my spirit water you;
              D                  D7
     When the saints need my supply,
               G           Em
     Then I’ll surely testify,
                D              A
     I’ll stand up, release my Christ and water
     D
     you!

2  In the meeting, when the spirit’s rising
   high,
   And it seems like we will go beyond the
   sky—
   I can’t help it, I must speak or else I’ll die,
   For my Christ is rising up to water you.

3  Should a pause come, or the meeting ebb
   real low,
   While within me there’s a rich and living
   flow,
   Then I’ll stand up, so that all the saints will
   know,
   That I’m here to share my Christ and water you.

4  In the church life, in our daily living too,
   In the meeting, and in everything we do,
   Christ is speaking and the Spirit’s breaking
   through,
   That is why there’s the supply to water you.

(Hymns, #1008)

New tune:
   D
1  What can wash away my sin?
                            Em
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
                           A
   What can make me whole again?
           A7               D
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.


     Oh! precious is the flow
          D7                G
     That makes me white as snow;
     G        D
     No other fount I know,
     G       A7               D
     Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Original tune:
   D      A         Bm     D
2  For my cleansing this I see—
   G               D     G  A  D
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
   D      A      Bm      D
   For my pardon this my plea—
   G               D     G  A  D
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

         A7       D
     Oh! precious is the flow
     Em         D  Em       A7
     That makes me white as snow;
     D  A     Bm      D
     No other fount I know,
     G               D     G  A D
     Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

3  Nothing can my sin erase
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
   Naught of works, ‘tis all of grace—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

4  This is all my hope and peace—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
   This is all my righteousness—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

(Capo 3)

   D               A7    D   G   Em
1  O soul, are you weary and troubled?
      D            A7           D  G
   No light in the darkness you see?
            D           B7         E  A
   There’s light for a look at the Savior,
       D          A       E7   A  A7
   And life more abundant and free.

     D         A7        Bm  D7
     Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
          G           Em        A - A7
     Look full in His wonderful face,
             D         F#m
     And the things of earth will grow
     Bm      D G
     strangely dim,
            D            A7        D  G  D
     In the light of His glory and grace.

2  Through death into life everlasting
   He passed, and we follow Him there;
   O’er us sin no more hath dominion
   For more than conqu’rors we are!

3  His Word shall not fail you, He promised;
   Believe Him and all will be well;
   Then go to a world that is dying,
   His perfect salvation to tell!
